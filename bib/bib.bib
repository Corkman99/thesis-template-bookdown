	abstract = {Abstract Heat waves such as the one in Europe 2003 have severe consequences for the economy, society, and ecosystems. It is unclear whether temperatures could have exceeded these anomalies even without further climate change. Developing storylines and quantifying the highest possible temperature levels is challenging given the lack of a long homogeneous time series and methodological framework to assess them. Here, we address this challenge by analyzing summer temperatures in a nearly 5000-yr preindustrial climate model simulation, performed with the Community Earth System Model CESM1. To assess how anomalous temperatures could get, we compare storylines generated by three different methods: 1) a return-level estimate, deduced from a generalized extreme value distribution; 2) a regression model, based on dynamic and thermodynamic heat wave drivers; and 3) a novel ensemble boosting method, generating large samples of reinitialized extreme heat waves in the long climate simulation. All methods provide consistent temperature estimates, suggesting that historical exceptional heat waves such as those in Chicago in 1995, Europe in 2003, and Russia in 2010 could have been substantially exceeded even in the absence of further global warming. These estimated unseen heat waves are caused by the same drivers as moderate observed events, but with more anomalous patterns. Moreover, altered contributions of circulation and soil moisture to temperature anomalies include amplified feedbacks in the surface energy budget. The methodological framework of combining different storyline approaches of heat waves with magnitudes beyond the observational record may ultimately contribute to adaptation and to the stress testing of ecosystems or socioeconomic systems to increase resilience to extreme climate stressors.},

	abstract = {Causal discovery from time series data is a typical problem setting across the sciences. Often, multiple datasets of the same system variables are available, for instance, time series of river runoff from different catchments. The local catchment systems then share certain causal parents, such as time-dependent large-scale weather over all catchments, but differ in other catchment-specific drivers, such as the altitude of the catchment. These drivers can be called temporal and spatial contexts, respectively, and are often partially unobserved. Pooling the datasets and considering the joint causal graph among system, context, and certain auxiliary variables enables us to overcome such latent confounding of system variables. In this work, we present a non-parametric time series causal discovery method, J(oint)-PCMCI+, that efficiently learns such joint causal time series graphs when both observed and latent contexts are present, including time lags. We present asymptotic consistency results and numerical experiments demonstrating the utility and limitations of the method.},

	abstract = {The gold standard for discovering causal relations is by means of experimentation. Over the last decades, alternative methods have been proposed that can infer causal relations between variables from certain statistical patterns in purely observational data. We introduce Joint Causal Inference (JCI), a novel approach to causal discovery from multiple data sets from different contexts that elegantly unifies both approaches. JCI is a causal modeling framework rather than a specific algorithm, and it can be implemented using any causal discovery algorithm that can take into account certain background knowledge. JCI can deal with different types of interventions (e.g., perfect, imperfect, stochastic, etc.) in a unified fashion, and does not require knowledge of intervention targets or types in case of interventional data. We explain how several well-known causal discovery algorithms can be seen as addressing special cases of the JCI framework, and we also propose novel implementations that extend existing causal discovery methods for purely observational data to the JCI setting. We evaluate different JCI implementations on synthetic data and on flow cytometry protein expression data and conclude that JCI implementations can considerably outperform state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1903.01672},
	abstract = {It is commonplace to encounter heterogeneous or nonstationary data, of which the underlying generating process changes across domains or over time. Such a distribution shift feature presents both challenges and opportunities for causal discovery. In this paper, we develop a framework for causal discovery from such data, called Constraint-based causal Discovery from heterogeneous/NOnstationary Data (CD-NOD), to find causal skeleton and directions and estimate the properties of mechanism changes. First, we propose an enhanced constraint-based procedure to detect variables whose local mechanisms change and recover the skeleton of the causal structure over observed variables. Second, we present a method to determine causal orientations by making use of independent changes in the data distribution implied by the underlying causal model, benefiting from information carried by changing distributions. After learning the causal structure, next, we investigate how to efficiently estimate the "driving force" of the nonstationarity of a causal mechanism. That is, we aim to extract from data a low-dimensional representation of changes. The proposed methods are nonparametric, with no hard restrictions on data distributions and causal mechanisms, and do not rely on window segmentation. Furthermore, we find that data heterogeneity benefits causal structure identification even with particular types of confounders. Finally, we show the connection between heterogeneity/nonstationarity and soft intervention in causal discovery. Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world data sets (task-fMRI and stock market data) are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.},

	abstract = {Summer heatwaves repeatedly affect extended regions in Europe, resulting in adverse economic, social, and ecological impacts. Recent events, e.g. the 2022 heatwave, also attract interest regarding the spatial shifts of their impact centers. Evaluations so far either investigated heatwave passages at pre-defined locations or employed algorithms to spatio-temporally track their core regions. Usually, the latter focus on single events, and thus often fail to generalize spatial heatwave tracks or ignore track characteristics. Here, we use a data-driven approach employing causal discovery to robustly characterize European heatwave tracks in single-model initial condition large ensemble (SMILE) climate simulations to overcome sampling uncertainties of observational records. This enables us to identify specific recurrent heatwave tracks, evaluate their preferential seasonal occurrence, and associate them with moving high pressure centers. Additionally, the evaluation of heatwave track representation in the SMILE extends standard model evaluation, which is mostly based on static statistics. We provide the first comprehensive analysis on heatwave tracks considering internal climate variability conducted within a SMILE, promoting the latter as a methodological testbed in climate extremes research.},

	abstract = {Causal representation learning is the task of identifying the underlying causal variables and their relations from high-dimensional observations, such as images. Recent work has shown that one can reconstruct the causal variables from temporal sequences of observations under the assumption that there are no instantaneous causal relations between them. In practical applications, however, our measurement or frame rate might be slower than many of the causal effects. This effectively creates "instantaneous" effects and invalidates previous identifiability results. To address this issue, we propose iCITRIS, a causal representation learning method that allows for instantaneous effects in intervened temporal sequences when intervention targets can be observed, e.g., as actions of an agent. iCITRIS identifies the potentially multidimensional causal variables from temporal observations, while simultaneously using a differentiable causal discovery method to learn their causal graph. In experiments on three datasets of interactive systems, iCITRIS accurately identifies the causal variables and their causal graph.},

Estimating causally-related latent variables from observations is particularly challenging as the latent variables are not uniquely recoverable in the most general case. In this work, we consider both a nonparametric, nonstationary setting and a parametric setting for the latent processes and propose two provable conditions under which temporally causal latent processes can be identified from their nonlinear mixtures. We propose LEAP, a theoretically-grounded framework that extends Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) by enforcing our conditions through proper constraints in causal process prior. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that temporally causal latent processes are reliably identified from observed variables under different dependency structures and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage history or nonstationarity information. This demonstrates that using temporal information to learn latent processes from their invertible nonlinear mixtures in an unsupervised manner, for which we believe our work is one of the first, seems promising even without sparsity or minimality assumptions.},

	abstract = {Independent Component Analysis (ICA) aims to recover independent latent variables from observed mixtures thereof. Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims instead to infer causally related (thus often statistically dependent) latent variables, together with the unknown graph encoding their causal relationships. We introduce an intermediate problem termed Causal Component Analysis (CauCA). CauCA can be viewed as a generalization of ICA, modelling the causal dependence among the latent components, and as a special case of CRL. In contrast to CRL, it presupposes knowledge of the causal graph, focusing solely on learning the unmixing function and the causal mechanisms. Any impossibility results regarding the recovery of the ground truth in CauCA also apply for CRL, while possibility results may serve as a stepping stone for extensions to CRL. We characterize CauCA identifiability from multiple datasets generated through different types of interventions on the latent causal variables. As a corollary, this interventional perspective also leads to new identifiability results for nonlinear ICA -- a special case of CauCA with an empty graph -- requiring strictly fewer datasets than previous results. We introduce a likelihood-based approach using normalizing flows to estimate both the unmixing function and the causal mechanisms, and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive synthetic experiments in the CauCA and ICA setting.},

	abstract = {Endowing deep neural networks with the ability to reason about cause and effect would be an important step to make them more robust and interpretable. In this work we propose a variational framework that allows deep networks to learn latent variables and their causal relationships from unstructured data, with no supervision, or labeled interventions. Starting from an abstract Structural Equation Model (SEM), we show that maximizing its posterior probability yields a similar construction to a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), but with a structured prior coupled by non-linear equations. This prior represents an interpretable SEM with learnable parameters (such as a physical model or dependence structure), which can be fitted to data while simultaneously learning the latent variables. Unfortunately, computing KL-divergences with this non-linear prior is intractable. We show how linearizing arbitrary SEMs via back-propagation produces local non-isotropic Gaussian priors, for which the KL-divergences can be computed efficiently and differentiably. We propose two versions, one for IID data (such as images) which detects related causal variables within a sample, and one for non-IID data (such as video) which detects variables that are also related over time. Our proposal is complementary to causal discovery techniques, which assume given variables, and instead discovers both variables and their causal relationships. We experiment with recovering causal models from images, and learning temporal relations based on the Super Mario Bros videogame.},

	abstract = {Fingerprints are key tools in climate change detection and attribution (D\&A) that are used to determine whether changes in observations are different from internal climate variability (detection), and whether observed changes can be assigned to specific external drivers (attribution). We propose a direct D\&A approach based on supervised learning to extract fingerprints that lead to robust predictions under relevant interventions on exogenous variables, i.e., climate drivers other than the target. We employ anchor regression, a distributionally-robust statistical learning method inspired by causal inference that extrapolates well to perturbed data under the interventions considered. The residuals from the prediction achieve either uncorrelatedness or mean independence with the exogenous variables, thus guaranteeing robustness. We define D\&A as a unified hypothesis testing framework that relies on the same statistical model but uses different targets and test statistics. In the experiments, we first show that the CO2 forcing can be robustly predicted from temperature spatial patterns under strong interventions on the solar forcing. Second, we illustrate attribution to the greenhouse gases and aerosols while protecting against interventions on the aerosols and CO2 forcing, respectively. Our study shows that incorporating robustness constraints against relevant interventions may significantly benefit detection and attribution of climate change.},

Causal parameters are optimal in terms of predictive accuracy if in the new distribution either many variables are affected by interventions or only some variables are affected, but the perturbations are strong. If the training and test distributions differ by a shift, causal parameters might be too conservative to perform well on the above task. This motivates anchor regression, a method that makes use of exogeneous variables to solve a relaxation of the causal minimax problem by considering a modification of the least-squares loss. The procedure naturally provides an interpolation between the solutions of ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares. We prove that the estimator satisfies predictive guarantees in terms of distributional robustness against shifts in a linear class; these guarantees are valid even if the instrumental variables assumptions are violated. If anchor regression and least squares provide the same answer (anchor stability), we establish that OLS parameters are invariant under certain distributional changes.

Discovering equations, laws and principles that are invariant, robust and causal explanations of the world has been fundamental in physical sciences throughout the centuries. Discoveries emerge from observing the world and, when possible, performing interventional studies in the system under study. With the advent of big data and the use of data-driven methods, causal and equation discovery fields have grown and made progress in computer science, physics, statistics, philosophy, and many applied fields. All these domains are intertwined and can be used to discover causal relations, physical laws, and equations from observational data. This paper reviews the concepts, methods, and relevant works on causal and equation discovery in the broad field of Physics and outlines the most important challenges and promising future lines of research. We also provide a taxonomy for observational causal and equation discovery, point out connections, and showcase a complete set of case studies in Earth and climate sciences, fluid dynamics and mechanics, and the neurosciences. This review demonstrates that discovering fundamental laws and causal relations by observing natural phenomena is being revolutionised with the efficient exploitation of observational data, modern machine learning algorithms and the interaction with domain knowledge.

Causal discovery analyses reveal that both waves are characterized by positive ocean-atmosphere feedbacks at daily timescales. Only for the eastern US, a long-lead causal link from SSTs to the Rossby wave exists, which generates summer temperature predictability. We show that this SST forcing mechanism originates from the evolution of the winter-to-spring Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). During pronounced winter-to-spring PDO phases (either positive or negative) eastern US summer temperature forecast skill more than doubles, providing a temporary window of enhanced long-lead predictability.},

While it has previously been shown that the dependence structure of the noise can provide hints to determine which of the two variables is the cause, we presently show that even in the deterministic (noise-free) case, there are asymmetries that can be exploited for causal inference. Our method is based on the idea that if the function and the probability density of the cause are chosen independently, then the distribution of the eﬀect will, in a certain sense, depend on the function. We provide a theoretical analysis of this method, showing that it also works in the low noise regime, and link it to information geometry. We report strong empirical results on various real-world data sets from diﬀerent domains.},

	abstract = {Causal questions are omnipresent in many scientific problems. While much progress has been made in the analysis of causal relationships between random variables, these methods are not well suited if the causal mechanisms only manifest themselves in extremes. This work aims to connect the two fields of causal inference and extreme value theory. We define the causal tail coefficient that captures asymmetries in the extremal dependence of two random variables. In the population case, the causal tail coefficient is shown to reveal the causal structure if the distribution follows a linear structural causal model. This holds even in the presence of latent common causes that have the same tail index as the observed variables. Based on a consistent estimator of the causal tail coefficient, we propose a computationally highly efficient algorithm that estimates the causal structure. We prove that our method consistently recovers the causal order and we compare it to other well-established and non-extremal approaches in causal discovery on synthetic and real data. The code is available as an open-access R package.},

Anchor regression has been developed to address this problem for a large class of causal graphical models, though the relationships between the variables are assumed to be linear. In this work, we tackle the nonlinear setting by proposing kernel anchor regression (KAR). Beyond the natural formulation using a classic two-stage least square estimator, we also study an improved variant that involves nonparametric regression in three separate stages. We provide convergence results for the proposed KAR estimators and the identifiability conditions for KAR to learn the nonlinear structural equation models (SEM). Experimental results demonstrate the superior performances of the proposed KAR estimators over existing baselines.},

Our main contribution involves proposing a generative framework in which to test for the independence between X and Y given Z, we first learn to infer the latent representations of target variables X and Y that contain no information about the conditioning variable Z. The latent variables are then investigated for any significant remaining dependencies, which can be performed using the conventional partial correlation test. The empirical evaluations show that LCIT outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines consistently under different evaluation metrics, and is able to adapt really well to both non-linear and high-dimensional settings on a diverse collection of synthetic and real data sets.},

We consider a test statistic based on generalized correlation between \$U\_1\$ and \$U\_2\$ and derive its large sample properties under consistency assumptions on the quantile regression procedure. We demonstrate through a simulation study that the resulting test is sound under complicated data generating distributions. Moreover, in the examples considered the test is competitive to other state-of-the-art conditional independence tests in terms of level and power, and it has superior power in cases with conditional variance heterogeneity of \$X\$ and \$Y\$ given \$Z\$.},

By attracting impressive support from citizens, whose activism takes the form of protests, boycotts, civil disobedience, and other forms of nonviolent noncooperation, these efforts help separate regimes from their main sources of power and produce remarkable results, even in Iran, Burma, the Philippines, and the Palestinian Territories.Combining statistical analysis with case studies of specific countries and territories, Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan detail the factors enabling such campaigns to succeed and, sometimes, causing them to fail. They find that nonviolent resistance presents fewer obstacles to moral and physical involvement and commitment, and that higher levels of participation contribute to enhanced resilience, greater opportunities for tactical innovation and civic disruption (and therefore less incentive for a regime to maintain its status quo), and shifts in loyalty among opponents' erstwhile supporters, including members of the military establishment. Chenoweth and Stephan conclude that successful nonviolent resistance ushers in more durable and internally peaceful democracies, which are less likely to regress into civil war. Presenting a rich, evidentiary argument, they originally and systematically compare violent and nonviolent outcomes in different historical periods and geographical contexts, debunking the myth that violence occurs because of structural and environmental factors and that it is necessary to achieve certain political goals. Instead, the authors discover, violent insurgency is rarely justifiable on strategic grounds.},

The ethics of climate activism has focused on two main questions. First, is there a duty to engage in climate activism? Answers to this question differ regarding how the duty is grounded, how demanding it is, and whether people in certain social roles have special duties to engage in climate activism. The second question is whether certain forms of climate activism are morally permissible, given certain frequently voiced concerns. Prominently, concerns about climate activism being ineffective, uninclusive, undemocratic, and violent. The review ends by pointing to other issues that the ethics of climate activism is likely to address in the near future.

Esteemed philosopher John Broome avoids the familiar ideological stances on climate change policy and examines the issue through an invigorating new lens. As he considers the moral dimensions of climate change, he reasons clearly through what universal standards of goodness and justice require of us, both as citizens and as governments. His conclusions—some as demanding as they are logical—will challenge and enlighten. Eco-conscious readers may be surprised to hear they have a duty to offset all their carbon emissions, while policy makers will grapple with Broome’s analysis of what if anything is owed to future generations. From the science of greenhouse gases to the intricate logic of cap and trade, Broome reveals how the principles that underlie everyday decision making also provide simple and effective ideas for confronting climate change.

Firstly, it facilitated a historic degree of unification within a previously divided movement, around a desire to focus less on influencing official negotiations, although the degree to which negotiations should be ignored, and what actions should focus on instead, created new cleavages. Secondly, organizers experienced that mobilizing around a summit whilst trying to ignore it is problematic, thus limiting strategic options and presenting an ‘efficacy dilemma’. This, finally, limited the movement’s success, and fueled desires for a transnational climate movement beyond COPs. Whether those desires can be realized without the organizational benefits of summit mobilizations remains unanswered.},

	abstract = {Environmental issues increasingly impact the well-being, the ability to have a good life, of people, especially members of marginalized groups. Dealing with environmental issues is a long-standing and increasing focus of activism. Youth are increasingly involved in environmental activism. One focus of environmental education is how to instill the role of being a change agent into students. Marginalized groups experience many problems in relation to environmental issues, and environmental activism impacts the lived experience of marginalized groups in diverse ways. A pre-study scoping review suggested a gap in academic inquiry around “the impact of environmental activism”. The aim of our study was to decrease this gap and to better understand the perceived impact of environmental activism. We used two approaches to achieve this aim. In the first step, we used a survey to ask undergraduate students about their views on the impact of environmental activism. Given the results of the survey and that students need access to information to be able to fulfill their roles as critical thinkers and change agents, we then performed a scoping review of abstracts from Scopus, Web of Science, and the 70 databases accessible through EBSCO-HOST to ascertain what topics and which marginalized groups are engaged with in the academic inquiry of environmental activism. We found that participants felt that environmental activism has an impact on all the social groups and entities we gave them as choices, although there were differences in how positively they viewed the different groups and entities being affected. The participants also indicated that many of the well-being indicators were impacted by environmental activism, although around 30\% felt that they did not have information they needed to form an opinion. Finally, our participants felt that different social groups have different ability expectations. Our scoping review found that many of the groups and indicators that our participants felt were impacted by environmental activism were not covered in the abstracts we analyzed. Our findings suggest many gaps and the need for actions and opportunities in relation to the topic of the “impact of environmental activism”.},

Although studies have analyzed climate activism and the climate movement, there is limited research that integrates it into the broader literature on civic engagement and which considers how these forms of engagement are related to specific climate outcomes. Here, we take a first step in understanding the material outcomes of these efforts. Specifically, we provide an overview of climate-related activism as a form of civic engagement, paying particular attention to the targets of this activism and its environmental outcomes in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Then, we focus on one of the most common tactics to gain momentum in recent years: the school strike, which has mobilized a growing number of participants around the world. We discuss how the Coronavirus pandemic has changed the climate movement with much activism moving online. We conclude by discussing the overall state of the knowledge about the outcomes of climate activism, as well as highlighting the need for careful research to measure its effects across scale.

Johnson argues that climate change has the structure of a tragedy of the commons, and that there is no unilateral obligation to reduce emissions in a commons. Against Johnson, I articulate two rationales for an individual obligation to reduce one's greenhouse gas emissions. I first discuss moral integrity, which recommends congruence between one's actions and positions at the personal and political levels. Second, I draw on a Confucian, relational conception of persons to offer a critique of the collective action/tragedy of the commons framework itself. Under the relational conception, commons problems can be reconceptualised so as to dissolve the stark contrast between the individually and the collectively rational. This perspective can inform our approach to climate change and help reconcile individual and political action to mitigate it.},

In her long-awaited Responsibility for Justice, Young discusses our responsibilities to address "structural" injustices in which we among many are implicated (but for which we not to blame), often by virtue of participating in a market, such as buying goods produced in sweatshops, or participating in booming housing markets that leave many homeless. Young argues that addressing these structural injustices requires a new model of responsibility, which she calls the "social connection" model. She develops this idea by clarifying the nature of structural injustice; developing the notion of political responsibility for injustice and how it differs from older ideas of blame and guilt; and finally how we can then use this model to describe our responsibilities to others no matter who we are and where we live.

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a growth in scholarship on the intertwined histories of climate, science, and European imperialism. Scholarship has focused both on how the material realities of climate shaped colonial enterprises, and on how ideas about climate informed imperial ideologies. Historians have shown how European expansion was justified by its protagonists with theories of racial superiority, which were often closely tied to ideas of climatic determinism. Meanwhile, the colonial spaces established by European powers offered novel “laboratories” where ideas about acclimatization and climatic improvement could be tested on the ground. While historical scholarship has focused on how powerful ideas of climate informed imperial projects, emerging scholarship in environmental history, history of science, and historical geography focuses instead on the material and cognitive practices by which the climates of colonial spaces were made known and dealt with in fields such as forestry, agriculture, and human health. These heretofore rather disparate areas of historical research carry great contemporary relevance for studies of how climates and their changes have been understood, debated, and adapted to in the past.

	abstract = {Calls for climate justice abound as evidence accumulates of the growing social and environmental injustices aggravated or driven by climate change. There is now a considerable and diverse literature on procedural, distributional and intergenerational dimensions, including questions of recognition in climate justice. Yet its meaning, scope and practical implications are still contested. Importantly, the broader landscape within which climate justice is situated is rapidly changing, bringing new challenges to the understanding and practice of climate justice. This review takes stock of climate justice literature in view of this new context. We find several disconnects and tensions between more philosophical and academic treatments of the subject on the one hand, and “activist”-oriented approaches to climate justice on the other. Scholarship often falls into silos around scales from global and local, between mitigation and adaptation or draws distinctions between climate justice and other forms of (in)justice. This inhibits an understanding of climate justice that can address more directly its underlying root causes in an historically constituted global economic system and intersecting set of social inequalities. We propose a research agenda centered on a transformative approach to climate justice, placing analysis of power in its various guises at the center of its enquiry, and subverting and moving beyond existing distinctions by focusing on the social and institutional relations and inequalities that both produce climate change and profoundly shape responses to it. We elaborate on three key strands of such an approach: inclusive climate justice, deepening climate justice and governance for climate justice.

	abstract = {Recent research introduced the concept of climate storylines as an alternative approach to estimate climate impact and better deal with uncertainties. A climate storyline is an event-based approach which aims at building “physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways”. As such, climate storylines may profit from downward counterfactual thinking, which aims at analyzing how past events could have been worse. Notwithstanding the various applications of downward counterfactual thinking in the natural risk management literature, no study relates this with the climate storyline approach. The main goal of this paper is thus to introduce a framework that supports the development of climate storylines from downward counterfactuals. The framework is event-oriented, it focuses on impact, and it is designed to be applied in a participatory fashion. As a proof-of-concept application, we study the impact of tropical cyclones on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) without conducting a participatory analysis. Tropical cyclones represent a serious threat for the European outermost regions, and their impact to the EUSF capital availability has never been studied. We find that payouts due to tropical cyclones can hamper a recovery of the fund if large payouts concurrently occur in mainland Europe. To avoid this also considering future changes, an increase in capitalization up to 90 \% percent may be required.},

We first show that the extreme near-surface 𝑇′ during the June 2021 heat wave in western North America was produced primarily by diabatic heating and, to a smaller extent, by adiabatic warming. Systematically decomposing 𝑇′ during the hottest days of each year (TX1day events) in 1979–2020 globally, we find strong geographical variations with a dominance of advection over mid-latitude oceans, adiabatic warming near mountain ranges and diabatic heating over tropical and subtropical land masses. In many regions, however, TX1day events arise from a combination of these processes. In the global mean, TX1day anomalies form along trajectories over roughly 60 h and 1,000 km, although with large regional variability. This study thus reveals inherently non-local and regionally distinct formation pathways of hot extremes, quantifies the crucial factors determining their magnitude and enables new quantitative ways of climate model evaluation regarding hot extremes.},

	abstract = {Climate models (CM) are used to evaluate the impact of climate change on the risk of floods and heavy precipitation events. However, these numerical simulators produce outputs with low spatial resolution that exhibit difficulties representing precipitation events accurately. This is mainly due to computational limitations on the spatial resolution used when simulating multi-scale weather dynamics in the atmosphere. To improve the prediction of high resolution precipitation we apply a Deep Learning (DL) approach using input data from a reanalysis product, that is comparable to a climate model’s output, but can be directly related to precipitation observations at a given time and location. Further, our input excludes local precipitation, but includes model fields (weather variables) that are more predictable and generalizable than local precipitation. To this end, we present TRU-NET (Temporal Recurrent U-Net), an encoder-decoder model featuring a novel 2D cross attention mechanism between contiguous convolutional-recurrent layers to effectively model multi-scale spatio-temporal weather processes. We also propose a non-stochastic variant of the conditional-continuous (CC) loss function to capture the zero-skewed patterns of rainfall. Experiments show that our models, trained with our CC loss, consistently attain lower RMSE and MAE scores than a DL model prevalent in precipitation downscaling and outperform a state-of-the-art dynamical weather model. Moreover, by evaluating the performance of our model under various data formulation strategies, for the training and test sets, we show that there is enough data for our deep learning approach to output robust, high-quality results across seasons and varying regions.},

	abstract = {VALUE is an open European collaboration to intercompare downscaling approaches for climate change research, focusing on different validation aspects (marginal, temporal, extremes, spatial, process-based, etc.). Here we describe the participating methods and first results from the first experiment, using “perfect” reanalysis (and reanalysis-driven regional climate model (RCM)) predictors to assess the intrinsic performance of the methods for downscaling precipitation and temperatures over a set of 86 stations representative of the main climatic regions in Europe. This study constitutes the largest and most comprehensive to date intercomparison of statistical downscaling methods, covering the three common downscaling approaches (perfect prognosis, model output statistics—including bias correction—and weather generators) with a total of over 50 downscaling methods representative of the most common techniques. Overall, most of the downscaling methods greatly improve (reanalysis or RCM) raw model biases and no approach or technique seems to be superior in general, because there is a large method-to-method variability. The main factors most influencing the results are the seasonal calibration of the methods (e.g., using a moving window) and their stochastic nature. The particular predictors used also play an important role in cases where the comparison was possible, both for the validation results and for the strength of the predictor–predictand link, indicating the local variability explained. However, the present study cannot give a conclusive assessment of the skill of the methods to simulate regional future climates, and further experiments will be soon performed in the framework of the EURO-CORDEX initiative (where VALUE activities have merged and follow on). Finally, research transparency and reproducibility has been a major concern and substantive steps have been taken. In particular, the necessary data to run the experiments are provided at http://www.value-cost.eu/data and data and validation results are available from the VALUE validation portal for further investigation: http://www.value-cost.eu/validationportal.},

Causal parameters are optimal in terms of predictive accuracy if in the new distribution either many variables are affected by interventions or only some variables are affected, but the perturbations are strong. If the training and test distributions differ by a shift, causal parameters might be too conservative to perform well on the above task. This motivates anchor regression, a method that makes use of exogenous variables to solve a relaxation of the ‘causal’ minimax problem by considering a modification of the least-squares loss. The procedure naturally provides an interpolation between the solutions of ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares. We prove that the estimator satisfies predictive guarantees in terms of distributional robustness against shifts in a linear class; these guarantees are valid even if the instrumental variable assumptions are violated. If anchor regression and least squares provide the same answer (‘anchor stability’), we establish that OLS parameters are invariant under certain distributional changes. Anchor regression is shown empirically to improve replicability and protect against distributional shifts.},

Systematically decomposing 𝑇′ during the hottest days of each year (TX1day events) in 1979–2020 globally, we find strong geographical variations with a dominance of advection over mid-latitude oceans, adiabatic warming near mountain ranges and diabatic heating over tropical and subtropical land masses. In many regions, however, TX1day events arise from a combination of these processes. In the global mean, TX1day anomalies form along trajectories over roughly 60 h and 1,000 km, although with large regional variability. This study thus reveals inherently non-local and regionally distinct formation pathways of hot extremes, quantifies the crucial factors determining their magnitude and enables new quantitative ways of climate model evaluation regarding hot extremes.},

	abstract = {The productivity of important agricultural crops is drastically reduced when they experience short episodes of high temperatures during the reproductive period. Crop heat stress was acknowledged in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report as an important threat to global food supply. We produce a first spatial assessment of heat stress risk at a global level for four key crops, wheat, maize, rice and soybean, using the FAO/IIASA Global Agro-Ecological Zones Model (GAEZ). A high risk of yield damage was found for continental lands at high latitudes, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere between 40 and 60°N. Central and Eastern Asia, Central North America and the Northern part of the Indian subcontinent have large suitable cropping areas under heat stress risk. Globally, this ranged from less than 5Mha of suitable lands for maize for the baseline climate (1971–2000) to more than 120Mha for wetland rice for a future climate change condition (2071–2100) assuming the A1B emission scenario. For most crops and regions, the intensity, frequency and relative damage due to heat stress increased from the baseline to the A1B scenario. However for wheat and rice crops, GAEZ selection of different crop types and sowing dates in response to A1B seasonal climate caused a reduction in heat stress impacts in some regions, which suggests that adaptive measures considering these management options may partially mitigate heat stress at local level. Our results indicate that temperate and sub-tropical agricultural areas might bear substantial crop yield losses due to extreme temperature episodes and they highlight the need to develop adaptation strategies and agricultural policies able to mitigate heat stress impacts on global food supply.},

In the selected years, the total estimated damages attributed to heatwaves amounted to 0.3–0.5\% of European gross domestic product (GDP). However, the identified losses were largely heterogeneous across space, consistently showing GDP impacts beyond 1\% in more vulnerable regions. Future projections indicate that by 2060 impacts might increase in Europe by a factor of almost five compared to the historical period 1981–2010 if no further mitigation or adaptation actions are taken, suggesting the presence of more pronounced effects in the regions where these damages are already acute.},

	abstract = {Extreme weather events in Europe are closely linked to anomalies of the atmospheric circulation and in particular to circulation features like cyclones and atmospheric blocking. In this study, this linkage is systematically characterised with the help of conditional cyclone and blocking frequencies during precipitation, wind gust and temperature extremes at various locations in Europe. Such conditional frequency fields can serve as a dynamical fingerprint of the extreme events and yield insights into their most important physical driving mechanisms. Precipitation extremes over the ocean and over flat terrain are shown to be closely related to cyclones in the vicinity and the associated dynamical lifting. For extreme precipitation over complex terrain, cyclone anomalies are found at more remote locations, favouring the flow of moist air towards the topography. Wind gust extremes are associated with cyclone and blocking anomalies in opposite directions, with the cyclones occurring mostly over the North and Baltic seas for extreme events in central Europe. This setting is associated with pronounced surface pressure gradients and thus high near-surface wind velocities. Hot temperature extremes in northern and central Europe typically occur in the vicinity of a blocking anticyclone, where subsidence and radiative forcing are strong. Over southern Europe, blocking anomalies are shifted more to the north or northeast, indicating a more important role of warm air advection. Large-scale flow conditions for cold extremes are similar at many locations in Europe, with blocking anomalies over the North Atlantic and northern Europe and cyclone anomalies southeast of the cold extreme, both contributing to the advection of cold air masses. This characterisation of synoptic-scale forcing mechanisms can be helpful for better understanding and anticipating weather extremes and their long-term changes.},

	abstract = {Between 15 and 19 March 2022, East Antarctica experienced an exceptional heat wave with widespread 30°–40°C temperature anomalies across the ice sheet. This record-shattering event saw numerous monthly temperature records being broken including a new all-time temperature record of −9.4°C on 18 March at Concordia Station despite March typically being a transition month to the Antarctic coreless winter. The driver for these temperature extremes was an intense atmospheric river advecting subtropical/midlatitude heat and moisture deep into the Antarctic interior. The scope of the temperature records spurred a large, diverse collaborative effort to study the heat wave’s meteorological drivers, impacts, and historical climate context. Here we focus on describing those temperature records along with the intricate meteorological drivers that led to the most intense atmospheric river observed over East Antarctica. These efforts describe the Rossby wave activity forced from intense tropical convection over the Indian Ocean. This led to an atmospheric river and warm conveyor belt intensification near the coastline, which reinforced atmospheric blocking deep into East Antarctica. The resulting moisture flux and upper-level warm-air advection eroded the typical surface temperature inversions over the ice sheet. At the peak of the heat wave, an area of 3.3 million km2 in East Antarctica exceeded previous March monthly temperature records. Despite a temperature anomaly return time of about 100 years, a closer recurrence of such an event is possible under future climate projections. In Part II we describe the various impacts this extreme event had on the East Antarctic cryosphere. Significance Statement In March 2022, a heat wave and atmospheric river caused some of the highest temperature anomalies ever observed globally and captured the attention of the Antarctic science community. Using our diverse collective expertise, we explored the causes of the event and have placed it within a historical climate context. One key takeaway is that Antarctic climate extremes are highly sensitive to perturbations in the midlatitudes and subtropics. This heat wave redefined our expectations of the Antarctic climate. Despite the rare chance of occurrence based on past climate, a future temperature extreme event of similar magnitude is possible, especially given anthropogenic climate change.},

Differences between methodologies and datasets in previous studies add uncertainty when comparing and quantifying findings. Here, the authors investigate the sensitivity of assessing global and regional temperature variability and extremes over 1980–2014 in gridded datasets of daily temperature anomalies. A gridded in situ–based dataset, Hadley Centre Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily (HadGHCND), is compared against several commonly used reanalysis products by assessing both the entire distribution and the tails of the distribution. Empirical probability distribution functions show sensitivity to the input dataset when estimating aspects such as standard deviation and skewness, with the mean showing robust results for most regions, irrespective of dataset choice. Standard deviation is especially sensitive, with larger disagreements between datasets for some regions more than others, such as Africa and the Mediterranean region, and with larger differences in minimum temperatures compared with maximum temperatures. Estimates of extreme parameters also show sensitivity to dataset choice, particularly in the lower tails and for daily minimum temperature anomalies. Comparing changes in the means and the extremes of the temperature distributions, the cold extremes in the lower tails have been warming at a faster rate than the mean of the entire distribution for much of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, with warm extremes warming at a faster rate than the mean in some subtropical regions. These documented sensitivities call for caution when assessing changes in temperature variability and extremes, as dataset choice can have substantial effects on results.},

Using a novel assessment of heat extremes, we investigate how extreme this event was in the global context. Characterizing the relative intensity of an event as the number of standard deviations from the mean, the western North America heat wave is remarkable, coming in at over four standard deviations. Throughout the globe, where we have reliable data, only five other heat waves were found to be more extreme since 1960. We find that in both reanalyses and climate projections, the statistical distribution of extremes increases through time, in line with the distribution mean shift due to climate change. Regions that, by chance, have not had a recent extreme heat wave may be less prepared for potentially imminent events.},

Judged by similarity with reanalyses, the new-generation models simulate the present-day temperature and precipitation extremes reasonably well. In line with previous CMIP simulations, the new simulations continue to project a large-scale picture of more frequent and more intense hot temperature extremes and precipitation extremes and vanishing cold extremes under continued global warming. Changes in temperature extremes outpace changes in global annual mean surface air temperature (GSAT) over most landmasses, while changes in precipitation extremes follow changes in GSAT globally at roughly the Clausius–Clapeyron rate of {\textasciitilde}7\% °C−1. Changes in temperature and precipitation extremes normalized with respect to GSAT do not depend strongly on the choice of forcing scenario or model climate sensitivity, and do not vary strongly over time, but with notable regional variations. Over the majority of land regions, the projected intensity increases and relative frequency increases tend to be larger for more extreme hot temperature and precipitation events than for weaker events. To obtain robust estimates of these changes at local scales, large initial-condition ensemble simulations are needed. Appropriate spatial pooling of data from neighboring grid cells within individual simulations can, to some extent, reduce the needed ensemble size.},

It has recently become apparent that large deviation theory (LDT) is very useful for investigating persistent extreme events, and specifically, for flexibly estimating long return periods and for introducing a notion of dynamical typicality. Using a methodological framework based on LDT and taking advantage of long simulations by a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we investigate the 2021 Western North America summer heatwave. Indeed, our analysis shows that the 2021 event can be seen as an unlikely but possible manifestation of climate variability, whilst its probability of occurrence is greatly amplified by the ongoing climate change. We also clarify the properties of spatial coherence of the 2021 heatwave and elucidate the role played by the Rocky Mountains in modulating hot, dry, and persistent extreme events in the Western Pacific region of North America.},

	abstract = {\&NA; Heat waves and high air temperature are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the majority of research conducted on this topic is focused on high income areas of the world. Although heat waves have the most severe impacts on vulnerable populations, relatively few studies have studied their impacts in low and middle income countries (LMICs). The aim of this paper is to review the existing evidence in the literature on the impact of heat on human health in LMICs. We identified peer‐reviewed epidemiologic studies published in English between January 1980 and August 2018 investigating potential associations between high ambient temperature or heat waves and mortality or morbidity. We selected studies according to the following criteria: quantitative studies that used primary and/or secondary data and report effect estimates where ambient temperature or heat waves are the main exposure of interest in relation to human morbidity or mortality within LMICs. Of the total 146 studies selected, eighty‐two were conducted in China, nine in other countries of East Asia and the Pacific, twelve in South Asia, ten in Sub‐Saharan Africa, eight in the Middle East and North Africa, and seven in each of Latin America and Europe. The majority of studies (92.9\%) found positive associations between heat and human morbidity/mortality. Additionally, while outcome variables and study design differed greatly, most utilized a time‐series study design and examined overall heath related morbidity/mortality impacts in an entire population, although it is notable that the selected studies generally found that the elderly, women, and individuals within the low socioeconomic brackets were the most vulnerable to the effects of high temperature. By highlighting the existing evidence on the impact of extreme heat on health in LMICs, we hope to determine data needs and help direct future studies in addressing this knowledge gap. The focus on LMICs is justified by the lack of studies and data studying the health burden of higher temperatures in these regions even though LMICs have a lower capacity to adapt to high temperatures and thus an increased risk. HighlightsThe majority of research conducted on the impacts of heat on health is focused on high income areas of the world.Most of the studies were conducted in China, and other countries of Asia and the Pacific.We provide recommendations regarding methodological challenges and alternative sources of health and environmental data.},

	abstract = {Background
The on-going climate change is predicted to yield a growing number of extreme climate events which will increase in both intensity and frequency. Increased longevity is changing society's demographics. It is very likely this will have a direct impact on population health. Many studies have previously shown that the elderly in a society are among the most vulnerable to heat waves.
Objectives
With a rapidly growing number of publications on this subject the objective was to review the recent literature for research regarding the impact of heat waves and elevated temperature on the elderly with regards to mortality and morbidity.
Methods
PubMed was searched to identify studies published in English between 1st of January 2008 and 31st of December 2010 using the following key words: heat wave, mortality, morbidity, elderly and temperature. The relationship between high temperature and mortality and/or morbidity had to be studied. Results for the elderly had to be provided.
Results
Six studies of temperature–morbidity-relationship were found and 24 studies of temperature–mortality-relationship. Studies consistently reported increases in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, as appeared also respiratory admissions to do during hot days and heat waves. However, the number of studies on morbidity published was much fewer. Few studies reported social, medical and environmental susceptibility factors.
Conclusions
Future research should focus on studying susceptibilities and to non-fatal events which are not as studied as mortality. Studies on the modification of type of urban environment, housing and mortality and morbidity in the elderly population are also needed.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The authors examined the increase in mortality associated with hot and cold temperature in different locations, the determinants of the variability in effect estimates, and its implications for adaptation.
Methods: The authors conducted a case-crossover study in 50 US cities. They used daily mortality and weather data for 6 513 330 deaths occurring during 1989–2000. Exposure was assessed using two approaches. First, the authors determined exposure to extreme temperatures using city-specific indicator variables based on the local temperature distribution. Secondly, they used piecewise linear variables to assess exposure to temperature on a continuous scale above/below a threshold. Effects of hot and cold temperature were examined in season-specific models. In a meta-analysis of the city-specific results, the authors examined several city characteristics as effect modifiers.
Results: Mortality increases associated with both extreme cold (2-day cumulative increase 1.59\% (95\% CI 0.56 to 2.63)) and extreme heat (5.74\% (95\% CI 3.38 to 8.15)) were found, the former being especially marked for myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest deaths. The increase in mortality was less marked at less extreme temperatures. The effect of extreme cold (defined as a percentile) was homogeneous across cities with different climates, suggesting that only the unusualness of the cold temperature (and not its absolute value) had a substantial impact on mortality (that is, acclimatisation to cold). Conversely, heat effects were quite heterogeneous, with the largest effects observed in cities with milder summers, less air conditioning and higher population density. Adjustment for ozone led to similar results, but some residual confounding could be present due to other uncontrolled pollutants.
Conclusions: The authors confirmed in a large sample of cities that both cold and hot temperatures increase mortality risk. These findings suggest that increases in heat-related mortality due to global warming are unlikely to be compensated for by decreases in cold-related mortality and that population acclimatisation to heat is still incomplete.},

	abstract = {Climate extremes, such as droughts or heat waves, can lead to harvest failures and threaten the livelihoods of agricultural producers and the food security of communities worldwide. Improving our understanding of their impacts on crop yields is crucial to enhance the resilience of the global food system. This study analyses, to our knowledge for the first time, the impacts of climate extremes on yield anomalies of maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat at the global scale using sub-national yield data and applying a machine-learning algorithm. We find that growing season climate factors—including mean climate as well as climate extremes—explain 20\%–49\% of the variance of yield anomalies (the range describes the differences between crop types), with 18\%–43\% of the explained variance attributable to climate extremes, depending on crop type. Temperature-related extremes show a stronger association with yield anomalies than precipitation-related factors, while irrigation partly mitigates negative effects of high temperature extremes. We developed a composite indicator to identify hotspot regions that are critical for global production and particularly susceptible to the effects of climate extremes. These regions include North America for maize, spring wheat and soy production, Asia in the case of maize and rice production as well as Europe for spring wheat production. Our study highlights the importance of considering climate extremes for agricultural predictions and adaptation planning and provides an overview of critical regions that are most susceptible to variations in growing season climate and climate extremes.},

	abstract = {Long-term warming trends across the globe have shifted the distribution of temperature variability, such that what was once classified as extreme heat relative to local mean conditions has become more common. This is also true for agricultural regions, where exposure to extreme heat, particularly during key growth phases such as the reproductive period, can severely damage crop production in ways that are not captured by most crop models. Here, we analyze exposure of crops to physiologically critical temperatures in the reproductive stage (Tcrit), across the global harvested areas of maize, rice, soybean and wheat. Trends for the 1980–2011 period show a relatively weak correspondence (r = 0.19) between mean growing season temperature and Tcrit exposure trends, emphasizing the importance of separate analyses for Tcrit. Increasing Tcrit exposure in the past few decades is apparent for wheat in Central and South Asia and South America, and for maize in many diverse locations across the globe. Maize had the highest percentage (15\%) of global harvested area exposed to at least five reproductive days over Tcrit in the 2000s, although this value is somewhat sensitive to the exact temperature used for the threshold. While there was relatively little sustained exposure to reproductive days over Tcrit for the other crops in the past few decades, all show increases with future warming. Using projections from climate models we estimate that by the 2030s, 31, 16, and 11\% respectively of maize, rice, and wheat global harvested area will be exposed to at least five reproductive days over Tcrit in a typical year, with soybean much less affected. Both maize and rice exhibit non-linear increases with time, with total area exposed for rice projected to grow from 8\% in the 2000s to 27\% by the 2050s, and maize from 15 to 44\% over the same period. While faster development should lead to earlier flowering, which would reduce reproductive extreme heat exposure for wheat on a global basis, this would have little impact for the other crops. Therefore, regardless of the impact of other global change factors (such as increasing atmospheric CO2), reproductive extreme heat exposure will pose risks for global crop production without adaptive measures such as changes in sowing dates, crop and variety switching, expansion of irrigation, and agricultural expansion into cooler areas.},

Many locations broke all-time maximum temperature records by more than 5 °C, and the Canadian national temperature record was broken by 4.6 °C, with a new record temperature of 49.6 °C. Here, we provide a comprehensive summary of this event and its impacts. Upstream diabatic heating played a key role in the magnitude of this anomaly. Weather forecasts provided advanced notice of the event, while sub-seasonal forecasts showed an increased likelihood of a heat extreme with lead times of 10-20 days. The impacts of this event were catastrophic, including hundreds of attributable deaths across the Pacific Northwest, mass-mortalities of marine life, reduced crop and fruit yields, river flooding from rapid snow and glacier melt, and a substantial increase in wildfires—the latter contributing to landslides in the months following. These impacts provide examples we can learn from and a vivid depiction of how climate change can be so devastating.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Using Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) simulations with different initial soil moisture (ISM) conditions, we investigate the sensitivity to ISM for the three severe heat wave events that dominated eastern China in 2003, 2007, and 2013. The control simulations are able to reproduce the spatial distributions and the daily evolutions for each of the three heat waves but apparently underestimate their amplitudes, intensities, and spatial extensions. The decreased ISM could cause an enhancement on heat waves with increased amplitudes, extents and intensities, while it has insignificant influence on the spatial distributions and temporal variations. The responses of heat waves are generally decreasing with the increasing ISM, controlled by different regimes in the surface soil moisture-temperature relationship. Through enhanced sensible flux as well as reduced latent cooling, the initial soil dryness locally strengthens the surface warming and the further drying of the soil. The three heat waves were all dominated by high-pressure systems in the mid-troposphere. The reduced ISM forces positive anomalies of geopotential height at mid-troposphere and negative anomalies at lower levels, leading to an enhanced thickness of the atmosphere. Such a thickened atmosphere can strengthen the anomalous high-pressure systems, favoring the maintenance of severe heat waves. This acts as a positive feedback between atmospheric circulation, surface warming, and soil dryness.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this study, the contribution of soil moisture–atmosphere interactions to surface temperature PDFs is investigated. Soil moisture represents a key variable in the coupling of the land and atmosphere, since it controls the partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat flux at the surface. Consequently, soil moisture variability driven by the atmosphere may feed back onto the near-surface climate—in particular, temperature. In this study, two simulations of the current-generation Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Earth System Model, with and without interactive soil moisture, are analyzed in order to assess how soil moisture dynamics impact the simulated climate. Comparison of these simulations shows that soil moisture dynamics enhance both temperature mean and variance over regional “hotspots” of land–atmosphere coupling. Moreover, higher-order distribution moments, such as skewness and kurtosis, are also significantly impacted, suggesting an asymmetric impact on the positive and negative extremes of the temperature PDF. Such changes are interpreted in the context of altered distributions of the surface turbulent and radiative fluxes. That the moments of the temperature distribution may respond differentially to soil moisture dynamics underscores the importance of analyzing moments beyond the mean and variance to characterize fully the interplay of soil moisture and near-surface temperature. In addition, it is shown that soil moisture dynamics impacts daily temperature variability at different time scales over different regions in the model.},

Currently, there are numerous studies for the Northern Hemisphere characterizing HWs and evaluating their impacts in several areas such as public health, economy, and agriculture. However, over South America, and in particular for Brazil, similar analysis is lacking despite its large geographical extension and numerous population potentially affected. Here we perform an assessment of HW events and characteristics recorded in six large Brazilian cities during the last five decades. The performed analysis reveals the existence of positive and significant trends in HW frequency since the 1980s, particularly for the cities of São Paulo, Manaus, and Recife. Over the last decades, Brasília was the city that recorded the highest number of days per year under a HW regime, contrasting with Rio de Janeiro that recorded the lowest value. The assessment of the large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns associated with summer HWs, indicated for Porto Alegre, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasília the presence of well-marked concentric and positive 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies followed by positive 850 hPa temperature anomalies. These anomalies are likely associated with quasi-stationary anticyclonic systems promoted by anomalous westward displacements of the South Atlantic Subtropical High System which are related to a weakening of other transients (and non-transient) systems such the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the South Atlantic Convergence Zone. For Manaus, the identified anomalies are linked to a northward displacement of the ITCZ. This configuration is compatible with an increase in solar radiative pattern and decreased soil moisture, enhancing surface temperature values, possibly associated with positive feedback mechanisms between soil and the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Heat waves in Amazonia have become more frequent, longer, and more intense according to observational records. Climate change and deforestation are two significant drivers of such trends. In the Amazon rainforest, heat waves are still an understudied issue, in part due to limited surface observations. To date, heat waves in central Amazon have been associated with the ITCZ northward migration in austral winter, weakening moisture influx through the South American Monsoon System. This study contributes to this topic by being the first Amazon-specific analysis of heat extremes and the first in South America to jointly explore extreme heat wave events and associated synoptic atmospheric and land surface conditions. Ten of the most extreme heat waves are identified in the Southeast of Amazonia, from Era-Interim (1979 to 2018) maximum daily temperature records. Dry conditions are measured from relative humidity and evaporative fraction anomalies at surface and vertically also using the Era-Interim data. In all 10 events an extreme drying signal co-occurs with extreme heat waves. Wind patterns and anomalies revealed a consistent easterly dry advection anomalously extending to Southeast Amazonia. In addition, an intensification of the northerly South Atlantic Anticyclone wind circulation reduced the influx of moisture to Southeast Amazon, namely linked to the South American Low Level Jet. These, together, contributed to a compound effect on the extreme heat waves under near-surface drying conditions, which escalated hot temperatures to extreme heat.},

	abstract = {The timing of melt onset affects the surface energy uptake throughout the melt season. Yet the processes triggering melt and causing its large interannual variability are not well understood. Here we show that melt onset over Arctic sea ice is initiated by positive anomalies of water vapor, clouds, and air temperatures that increase the downwelling longwave radiation (LWD) to the surface. The earlier melt onset occurs; the stronger are these anomalies. Downwelling shortwave radiation (SWD) is smaller than usual at melt onset, indicating that melt is not triggered by SWD. When melt occurs early, an anomalously opaque atmosphere with positive LWD anomalies preconditions the surface for weeks preceding melt. In contrast, when melt begins late, clearer than usual conditions are evident prior to melt. Hence, atmospheric processes are imperative for melt onset. It is also found that spring LWD increased during recent decades, consistent with trends toward an earlier melt onset.},

	abstract = {An extreme warming event near the North Pole, with 2 m temperature rising above 0 °C, was observed in late December 2015. This specific event has been attributed to cyclones and their associated moisture intrusions. However, little is known about the characteristics and drivers of similar events in the historical record. Here, using data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis, version 5 (ERA5), we study these winter extreme warming events with 2 m temperature over a grid point above 0 °C over the high Arctic (poleward of 80° N) that occurred during 1980–2021. In ERA5, such wintertime extreme warming events can only be found over the Atlantic sector. They occur rarely over many grid points, with a total absence during some winters. Furthermore, even when occurring, they tend to be short-lived, with the majority of the events lasting for less than a day. By examining their surface energy budget, we found that these events transition with increasing latitude from a regime dominated by turbulent heat flux into the one dominated by downward longwave radiation. Positive sea level pressure anomalies which resemble blocking over northern Eurasia are identified as a key ingredient in driving these events, as they can effectively deflect the eastward propagating cyclones poleward, leading to intense moisture and heat intrusions into the high Arctic. Using an atmospheric river (AR) detection algorithm, the roles of ARs in contributing to the occurrence of these extreme warming events defined at the grid-point scale are explicitly quantified. The importance of ARs in inducing these events increases with latitude. Poleward of about 83° N, 100 \% of these events occurred under AR conditions, corroborating that ARs were essential in contributing to the occurrence of these events. Over the past 4 decades, both the frequency, duration, and magnitude of these events have been increasing significantly. As the Arctic continues to warm, these events are likely to increase in both frequency, duration, and magnitude, with great implications for the local sea ice, hydrological cycle, and ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Arctic warm extremes and anomalous sea ice melting have been linked to episodic injections of warm and moist air from midlatitudes, as well as airmass transformations inside the Arctic. However, the relative importance of remote and local processes for such events remains unclear. Here, we focus on events with extreme positive daily-mean surface energy budget (SEB) anomalies over Arctic sea ice in ERA5 data during extended winters (November–March during 1979–2020). Kinematic backward trajectories from the tropospheric column collocated with the SEB anomalies show that near-surface air is of Arctic origin, whereas air farther aloft is transported poleward from the midlatitudes and ascends. Despite the different origin of the air, the entire tropospheric column shows pronounced potential temperature anomalies (on the order of 10 K) building up along air-parcel trajectories over 2–4 days. Quantifying the contributions of horizontal and vertical transport as well as diabatic processes to the generation of these potential temperature anomalies emphasizes the relevance of horizontal advection across the climatological potential temperature gradient for the generation of the anomalies at all levels. Anomalies aloft are further enhanced by latent heating and those near the surface by subsidence, respectively. Surface heat fluxes over subpolar and polar oceans are key for warming and moistening the near-surface air of predominantly Arctic origin and maintaining a positive potential temperature anomaly, which due to its proximity to the surface unfolds the strongest impact on the SEB. This suggests that Arctic airmasses and their local transformations are crucial for generating the most extreme SEB anomalies.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are expected to lead to more frequent and intense summer temperature extremes, not only due to the mean warming itself, but also due to changes in temperature variability. To test this hypothesis, we analyse daily output of ten PRUDENCE regional climate model scenarios over Europe for the 2071–2100 period. The models project more frequent temperature extremes particularly over the Mediterranean and the transitional climate zone (TCZ, between the Mediterranean to the south and the Baltic Sea to the north). The projected warming of the uppermost percentiles of daily summer temperatures is found to be largest over France (in the region of maximum variability increase) rather than the Mediterranean (where the mean warming is largest). The underlying changes in temperature variability may arise from changes in (1) interannual temperature variability, (2) intraseasonal variability, and (3) the seasonal cycle. We present a methodology to decompose the total daily variability into these three components. Over France and depending upon the model, the total daily summer temperature variability is projected to significantly increase by 20–40\% as a result of increases in all three components: interannual variability (30–95\%), seasonal variability (35–105\%), and intraseasonal variability (10–30\%). Variability changes in northern and southern Europe are substantially smaller. Over France and parts of the TCZ, the models simulate a progressive warming within the summer season (corresponding to an increase in seasonal variability), with the projected temperature change in August exceeding that in June by 2–3 K. Thus, the most distinct warming is superimposed upon the maximum of the current seasonal cycle, leading to a higher intensity of extremes and an extension of the summer period (enabling extreme temperatures and heat waves even in September). The processes driving the variability changes are different for the three components but generally relate to enhanced land–atmosphere coupling and/or increased variability of surface net radiation, accompanied by a strong reduction of cloudiness, atmospheric circulation changes and a progressive depletion of soil moisture within the summer season. The relative contribution of these processes differs substantially between models.},

Using an ensemble of coupled climate models, we examine the regional warming rates of hot extremes relative to annual average warming rates in the same regions. We identify hot spots of accelerated warming of model-simulated hot extremes in Europe, North America, South America, and Southeast China. These hot spots indicate where the warm tail of a distribution of temperatures increases faster than the average and are robust across most Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models. Exploring the conditions on the specific day when the hot extreme occurs demonstrates that the hot spots are explained by changes in the surface energy fluxes consistent with drying soils. However, the model-simulated accelerated warming of hot extremes appears inconsistent with observations, except over Europe. The simulated acceleration of hot extremes may therefore be unreliable, a result that necessitates a reevaluation of how climate models resolve the relevant terrestrial processes.},

	abstract = {Land-atmosphere interactions play an important role for hot temperature extremes in Europe. Dry soils may amplify such extremes through feedbacks with evapotranspiration. While previous observational studies generally focused on the relationship between precipitation deficits and the number of hot days, we investigate here the influence of soil moisture (SM) on summer monthly maximum temperatures (TXx) using water balance model-based SM estimates (driven with observations) and temperature observations. Generalized extreme value distributions are fitted to TXx using SM as a covariate. We identify a negative relationship between SM and TXx, whereby a 100mm decrease in model-based SM is associated with a 1.6°C increase in TXx in Southern-Central and Southeastern Europe. Dry SM conditions result in a 2–4°C increase in the 20-year return value of TXx compared to wet conditions in these two regions. In contrast with SM impacts on the number of hot days (NHD), where low and high surface-moisture conditions lead to different variability, we find a mostly linear dependency of the 20-year return value on surface-moisture conditions. We attribute this difference to the non-linear relationship between TXx and NHD that stems from the threshold-based calculation of NHD. Furthermore the employed SM data and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) are only weakly correlated in the investigated regions, highlighting the importance of evapotranspiration and runoff for resulting SM. Finally, in a case study for the hot 2003 summer we illustrate that if 2003 spring conditions in Southern-Central Europe had been as dry as in the more recent 2011 event, temperature extremes in summer would have been higher by about 1°C, further enhancing the already extreme conditions which prevailed in that year.},

	abstract = {Recent temperature extremes have highlighted the importance of assessing projected changes in the variability of temperature as well as the mean. A large fraction of present-day temperature variance is associated with thermal advection, as anomalous winds blow across the land–sea temperature contrast, for instance. Models project robust heterogeneity in the twenty-first-century warming pattern under greenhouse gas forcing, resulting in land–sea temperature contrasts increasing in summer and decreasing in winter and the pole-to-equator temperature gradient weakening in winter. In this study, future changes in monthly variability of near-surface temperature in the 17-member ensemble ESSENCE (Ensemble Simulations of Extreme Weather Events under Nonlinear Climate Change) are assessed. In winter, variability in midlatitudes decreases whereas in very high latitudes and the tropics it increases. In summer, variability increases over most land areas and in the tropics, with decreasing variability in high latitude oceans. Multiple regression analysis is used to determine the contributions to variability changes from changing temperature gradients and circulation patterns. Thermal advection is found to be of particular importance in the Northern Hemisphere winter midlatitudes, where the change in mean state temperature gradients alone could account for over half the projected changes. Changes in thermal advection are also found to be important in summer in Europe and coastal areas, although less so than in winter. Comparison with CMIP5 data shows that the midlatitude changes in variability are robust across large regions, particularly high northern latitudes in winter and middle northern latitudes in summer.},

All regional model integrations, carried out in the PRUDENCE project, use the same boundaries of the HadAM3H global atmospheric model. Compared to the CRU TS 2.0 observational data set most RCMs (but not all) overpredict the temperature variability significantly in their control simulation. The behaviour of the different regional climate models is analysed in terms of the surface energy budget, and the contributions of the different terms in the surface energy budget to the temperature variability are estimated. This analysis shows a clear relation in the model ensemble between temperature variability and the combined effects of downward long wave, net short wave radiation and evaporation (defined as F). However, it appears that the overestimation of the temperature variability has no unique cause. The effect of short-wave radiation dominates in some RCMs, whereas in others the effect of evaporation dominates. In all models the temperature variability and F increase when imposing future climate boundary conditions, with particularly high values in central Europe.},

	abstract = {The decadal variability of extreme high temperature (EHT) in the mid and highlatitudes of continental Asia (MHLCA) and associated mechanisms were investigated. Observational analysis indicated that, after removing global warming, the first leading mode of the EHT events showed a meridional dipole pattern and had significant decadal variability. During the periods 1980–1994 and 2012–2019 (1995–2011), EHT events were more frequent and stronger (less frequent and weaker) in western-central Siberia than normal, whereas they were less frequent and weaker (more frequent and stronger) in the wide area to the south of Lake Baikal. Further Observational and CESM (Community Earth System Model) results based analysis suggested that decadal change in air–sea interaction in the North Atlantic play an important role in shaping the decadal variability of EHT events in MHLCA. On decadal timescales, meridional negative–positive–negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North Atlantic and their coupled positive North Atlantic Oscillation can trigger stronger wave activity flux and cause a significant anticyclonic–cyclonic teleconnection wave train in the troposphere over the mid and high latitudes of the Eurasian continent. As a result, an anomalous high-pressure center is evident in western-central Siberia, and thereby reducing total cloud cover and causing stronger solar heating. Thus, EHT events become more frequent and stronger. On the contrary, for the areas south of Lake Baikal, EHT events are weakened by corresponding cyclonic circulation anomalies. Additionally, the CAM5 (Community Atmosphere Model version 5) experiments suggested more important driving role of the decadal North Atlantic tripole SST anomalies in the abovementioned processes.},

	abstract = {The occurrence of very high temperatures (hot extremes) is often linked with negative impacts in human health, natural ecosystems and the economy (e.g., energy, water supply and agriculture). Studies have invariably shown that the intensity and frequency of hot extremes will increase in the future thus increasing their associated risks. While much progress has been made in quantifying and understanding hot temperature extremes and their future changes, there are still open questions. This paper focusses on the sources of hot extremes and their changes by applying a simple and unambiguous methodology that describes daily hot extremes as the superposition of four well known physical terms that include information on the annual mean temperature, the amplitude of the annual cycle, the diurnal temperature range and the local temperature anomaly on the day of the extreme. The methodology was applied to 30-year daily temperature records from 6 observation-based datasets and 31 atmosphere-ocean global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The comparison between observed and simulated hot extremes shows a remarkably consistent picture where most CMIP5 models overestimate the term describing the local temperature extreme anomaly over most regions of the globe regardless of the observed dataset considered. Simultaneously, CMIP5 models show a systematic cold bias in the annual mean temperature and in the diurnal temperature range terms leading to substantial error compensation over some regions. This prompted us to define a new error estimator as the sum of errors in individual terms that appears to be much more effective at characterising model's performance compared to the traditional bias estimator. The assessment of future changes in hot extremes shows that changes are dominated by changes in annual mean temperatures with varying contributions from the other terms that strongly depend on the specific region being considered. Western Europe appears as a hot spot for extreme temperature changes (increases of {\textasciitilde}8 ∘C by the end of the century) due to significant contributions from all decomposition terms including the summer mean anomaly, the diurnal temperature range and the daily extreme anomaly. Tropical South America also appears as a hot spot for extreme temperature changes (increases of {\textasciitilde}7 ∘C) largely due to an increase in the daily extreme anomaly term (explaining about 30\% of the full change) making this region one of the most sensitive regions in the world in terms of hot extremes. The analysis reveals that the separation of future changes according to terms describing mean, variability and tails is very sensitive to the specific way the mean component is defined including assumptions about stationarity.},

	abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is an essential paradigm in Earth and Environmental Systems modeling. However, the term “sensitivity” has a clear definition, based in partial derivatives, only when specified locally around a particular point (e.g., optimal solution) in the problem space. Accordingly, no unique definition exists for “global sensitivity” across the problem space, when considering one or more model responses to different factors such as model parameters or forcings. A variety of approaches have been proposed for global sensitivity analysis, based on different philosophies and theories, and each of these formally characterizes a different “intuitive” understanding of sensitivity. These approaches focus on different properties of the model response at a fundamental level and may therefore lead to different (even conflicting) conclusions about the underlying sensitivities. Here we revisit the theoretical basis for sensitivity analysis, summarize and critically evaluate existing approaches in the literature, and demonstrate their flaws and shortcomings through conceptual examples. We also demonstrate the difficulty involved in interpreting “global” interaction effects, which may undermine the value of existing interpretive approaches. With this background, we identify several important properties of response surfaces that are associated with the understanding and interpretation of sensitivities in the context of Earth and Environmental System models. Finally, we highlight the need for a new, comprehensive framework for sensitivity analysis that effectively characterizes all of the important sensitivity-related properties of model response surfaces.},

	abstract = {Extreme temperatures have warmed substantially over recent decades and are projected to continue warming in response to future climate change. Warming of extreme temperatures is amplified over land, with severe implications for human health, wildfire risk and food production. Using simulations from 18 climate models, I show that hot days over tropical land warm substantially more than the average day. For example, warming of the hottest 5\% of land days is a factor of 1.21 ± 0.07 larger than the time-mean warming averaged across models. The climate change response of extreme temperatures over tropical land is interpreted using a theory based on atmospheric dynamics. According to the theory, warming is amplified for hot land days because those days are dry, which is termed the ‘drier get hotter’ mechanism. Changes in near-surface relative humidity further increase tropical land warming, with decreases in land relative humidity being particularly important. The theory advances physical understanding of the tropical climate and highlights land surface dryness as a key factor determining how extreme temperatures respond to climate change.},

Applying this framework to near-surface and free-tropospheric T′ associated with the record-shattering 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest shows that ascending, diabatic air streams in North Pacific cyclones contribute more than 50\% of free-tropospheric T′, whereas near-surface T′ is mainly produced by local subsidence and diabatic heating with only marginal upstream contributions. Since free-tropospheric T′ facilitates near-surface accumulation of locally produced T′ by rendering the atmosphere stable to moist convection, our findings corroborate the notion of top-down induced heatwave formation fueled by upstream diabatic processes.},

	abstract = {Since temperature extremes have a strong impact on environment and society, it is crucial to understand their underlying mechanisms. While their relationship to the large-scale atmospheric circulation has been comprehensively investigated, the role of physical processes in the formation of air masses with extreme temperatures is less well understood. This study presents a Lagrangian analysis of the 0.1\% most extreme six-hourly hot and cold events in three European regions (UK, Central Europe, Balkans) for the time period 1989–2009. The results provide insight into typical transport patterns and physical processes (adiabatic compression, radiation, surface heat fluxes) occurring along the trajectories of extreme temperature air masses. Cold events in Europe are most frequently induced by advection of cold air masses from the Arctic and Russia. The transport to the target region is characterized by a temperature increase caused by adiabatic compression and, in the maritime setting of the UK, also by diabatic heating due to surface sensible heat fluxes. Despite the warming along the trajectories, the extremeness of the associated 2 m temperature increases, due to the dislocation of the air mass to regions with a milder climate. Hot events are generally associated with weaker horizontal transport, but strong adiabatic warming and local temperature increase caused by enhanced radiation and surface heat fluxes. This in situ warming is particularly strong in Central Europe. Evaluating the temperature evolution along the trajectories reveals that hot and cold extremes develop on a similar time-scale of 2–3 days. This time-scale is mostly set by physical processes for hot extremes and controlled by advective transport for cold extremes. The diagnostics applied in this study lead to an improved process understanding that can provide a basis for more accurate predictions of temperature extremes.},

	abstract = {Lagrangian trajectories are widely used in the atmospheric sciences, for instance to identify flow structures in extratropical cyclones (e.g., warm conveyor belts) and long-range transport pathways of moisture and trace substances. Here a new version of the Lagrangian analysis tool LAGRANTO (Wernli and Davies, 1997) is introduced, which offers considerably enhanced functionalities. Trajectory starting positions can be defined easily and flexibly based on different geometrical and/or meteorological conditions, e.g., equidistantly spaced within a prescribed region and on a stack of pressure (or isentropic) levels. After the computation of the trajectories, a versatile selection of trajectories is offered based on single or combined criteria. These criteria are passed to LAGRANTO with a simple command language (e.g., "GT:PV:2" readily translates into a selection of all trajectories with potential vorticity, PV, greater than 2 PVU; 1 PVU = 10−6 K m2 kg−1 s−1). Full versions of this new version of LAGRANTO are available for global ECMWF and regional COSMO data, and core functionality is provided for the regional WRF and MetUM models and the global 20th Century Reanalysis data set. The paper first presents the intuitive application of LAGRANTO for the identification of a warm conveyor belt in the North Atlantic. A further case study then shows how LAGRANTO can be used to quasi-operationally diagnose stratosphere–troposphere exchange events. Whereas these examples rely on the ECMWF version, the COSMO version and input fields with 7 km horizontal resolution serve to resolve the rather complex flow structure associated with orographic blocking due to the Alps, as shown in a third example. A final example illustrates the tool's application in source–receptor analysis studies. The new distribution of LAGRANTO is publicly available and includes auxiliary tools, e.g., to visualize trajectories. A detailed user guide describes all LAGRANTO capabilities.},

	abstract = {Although heat waves account for more premature deaths in the Australian region than any other natural disaster, an understanding of their dynamics is still incomplete. The present study identifies the dynamical mechanisms responsible for heat waves in southeastern Australia using 10-day backward trajectories computed from the ERA-Interim reanalyses. Prior to the formation of a heat wave, trajectories located over the south Indian Ocean and over Australia in the lower and midtroposphere ascend diabatically ahead of an upper-level trough and over a baroclinic zone to the south of the continent. These trajectories account for 44\% of all trajectories forming the anticyclonic upper-level potential vorticity anomalies that characterize heat waves in the region. At the same time, trajectories located over the south Indian Ocean in the lower part of the troposphere descend and aggregate over the Tasman Sea. This descent is accompanied by a strong adiabatic warming. A key finding is that the temperatures are raised further through diabatic heating in the boundary layer over eastern Australia but not over the inner Australian continent. From eastern Australia, the air parcels are advected southward as they become incorporated into the near-surface anticyclone that defines the heat wave. In contrast to past studies, the importance of cloud-diabatic processes in the evolution of the midlatitude large-scale flow and the role of adiabatic compression in elevating the near-surface temperatures is emphasized. Likewise, the role of the local surface sensible heat fluxes is deemphasized.},

	abstract = {Understanding and quantifying the relationships between evaporation of water in one region, precipitation in another, and the transport processes connecting them, is one of the key problems in hydrometeorology. However, to date few methods exist that are suitable for establishing these relationships. In this paper, a new Lagrangian technique is described that builds on methods that have been developed for investigating source–receptor relationships for air pollutants. It is based on meteorological analysis data and a particle dispersion model and uses a Lagrangian analog to the Eulerian budget method to diagnose the surface moisture flux. Because of its Lagrangian nature, regions of net evaporation are connected by trajectories with regions of net precipitation, and these trajectories can be used to examine how the two are related. The method is shown to yield estimates for the global distribution of the annual mean surface freshwater flux that are equally accurate as those obtained with the Eulerian budget method. It is then applied in a case study of an extreme precipitation event that occurred in central Europe in August 2002 and led to floodings with return periods of 100 to 300 yr in some river catchments. Again it is shown that the moisture fluxes obtained with the Lagrangian and Eulerian method, respectively, agree well with each other, and both agree well with observed precipitation patterns and short-range precipitation forecasts. Then the new method is used to determine where the water that became precipitation during the flooding event has evaporated. It is found that in addition to a strong Mediterranean source, much of the water evaporated from land. The strong extra evaporation over land was likely due to a wet spell the weeks before that left soils saturated with water in large parts of Europe and flooded in some smaller regions. It appears that precipitation forecasts suffered from predicting too little evaporation in these regions.},

Ratios between components of a composition are important since they are unaffected by the particular set of components chosen. Logarithms of ratios (logratios) are the fundamental transformation in the ratio approach to compositional data analysis—all data thus need to be strictly positive, so that zero values present a major problem. Components that group together based on domain knowledge can be amalgamated (i.e., summed) to create new components, and this can alleviate the problem of data zeros. Once compositional data are transformed to logratios, regular univariate and multivariate statistical analysis can be performed, such as dimension reduction and clustering, as well as modeling. Alternative methodologies that come close to the ideals of the logratio approach are also considered, especially those that avoid the problem of data zeros, which is particularly acute in large bioinformatic data sets.},

Blocking occurs less often than other destructive phenomena, but globally their occurrence has increased since the beginning of the century. The longevity of blocking means it can negatively impact agricultural and economic activity and human comfort by bringing extreme conditions not only to the areas where they occur but also to locations well upstream and downstream. Additionally, while it is known where blocking occurs and their general character has been well described, operational models still struggle to replicate the intensity and duration even though improvement has been noted in the timing and location of onset. Climatologically, models still underestimate their occurrence. In the last 40 years, investigators have used case study analysis and numerical and theoretical models to understand the onset and maintenance of blocking. Comparatively few have examined block decay.

	abstract = {The physical understanding and timely prediction of extreme weather events are of enormous importance to society due to their associated impacts. In this article, we highlight several types of weather extremes occurring in Europe in connection with a particular atmospheric flow pattern, known as atmospheric blocking. This flow pattern effectively blocks the prevailing westerly large-scale atmospheric flow, resulting in changing flow anomalies in the vicinity of the blocking system and persistent conditions in the immediate region of its occurrence. Blocking systems are long-lasting, quasi-stationary and self-sustaining systems that occur frequently over certain regions. Their presence and characteristics have an impact on the predictability of weather extremes and can thus be used as potential indicators. The phasing between the surface and the upper-level blocking anomalies is of major importance for the development of the extreme event. In summer, heat waves and droughts form below the blocking anticyclone primarily via large-scale subsidence that leads to cloud-free skies and, thus, persistent shortwave radiative warming of the ground. In winter, cold waves that occur during atmospheric blocking are normally observed downstream or south of these systems. Here, meridional advection of cold air masses from higher latitudes plays a decisive role. Depending on their location, blocking systems also may lead to a shift in the storm track, which influences the occurrence of wind and precipitation anomalies. Due to these multifaceted linkages, compound events are often observed in conjunction with blocking conditions. In addition to the aforementioned relations, the predictability of extreme events associated with blocking and links to climate change are assessed. Finally, current knowledge gaps and pertinent research perspectives for the future are discussed.},
