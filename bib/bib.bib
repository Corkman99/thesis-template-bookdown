	abstract = {Recent research introduced the concept of climate storylines as an alternative approach to estimate climate impact and better deal with uncertainties. A climate storyline is an event-based approach which aims at building ‚Äúphysically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways‚Äù. As such, climate storylines may profit from downward counterfactual thinking, which aims at analyzing how past events could have been worse. Notwithstanding the various applications of downward counterfactual thinking in the natural risk management literature, no study relates this with the climate storyline approach. The main goal of this paper is thus to introduce a framework that supports the development of climate storylines from downward counterfactuals. The framework is event-oriented, it focuses on impact, and it is designed to be applied in a participatory fashion. As a proof-of-concept application, we study the impact of tropical cyclones on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) without conducting a participatory analysis. Tropical cyclones represent a serious threat for the European outermost regions, and their impact to the EUSF capital availability has never been studied. We find that payouts due to tropical cyclones can hamper a recovery of the fund if large payouts concurrently occur in mainland Europe. To avoid this also considering future changes, an increase in capitalization up to 90 \% percent may be required.},

	abstract = {Heat waves are among the deadliest climate hazards. Yet the relative importance of the physical processes causing their near-surface temperature anomalies (ùëá‚Ä≤)‚Äîadvection of air from climatologically warmer regions, adiabatic warming in subsiding air and diabatic heating‚Äîis still a matter of debate. Here we quantify the importance of these processes by evaluating the ùëá‚Ä≤ budget along air-parcel backward trajectories. We first show that the extreme near-surface ùëá‚Ä≤ during the June 2021 heat wave in western North America was produced primarily by diabatic heating and, to a smaller extent, by adiabatic warming. Systematically decomposing ùëá‚Ä≤ during the hottest days of each year (TX1day events) in 1979‚Äì2020 globally, we find strong geographical variations with a dominance of advection over mid-latitude oceans, adiabatic warming near mountain ranges and diabatic heating over tropical and subtropical land masses. In many regions, however, TX1day events arise from a combination of these processes. In the global mean, TX1day anomalies form along trajectories over roughly 60 h and 1,000 km, although with large regional variability. This study thus reveals inherently non-local and regionally distinct formation pathways of hot extremes, quantifies the crucial factors determining their magnitude and enables new quantitative ways of climate model evaluation regarding hot extremes.},

	abstract = {The productivity of important agricultural crops is drastically reduced when they experience short episodes of high temperatures during the reproductive period. Crop heat stress was acknowledged in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report as an important threat to global food supply. We produce a first spatial assessment of heat stress risk at a global level for four key crops, wheat, maize, rice and soybean, using the FAO/IIASA Global Agro-Ecological Zones Model (GAEZ). A high risk of yield damage was found for continental lands at high latitudes, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere between 40 and 60¬∞N. Central and Eastern Asia, Central North America and the Northern part of the Indian subcontinent have large suitable cropping areas under heat stress risk. Globally, this ranged from less than 5Mha of suitable lands for maize for the baseline climate (1971‚Äì2000) to more than 120Mha for wetland rice for a future climate change condition (2071‚Äì2100) assuming the A1B emission scenario. For most crops and regions, the intensity, frequency and relative damage due to heat stress increased from the baseline to the A1B scenario. However for wheat and rice crops, GAEZ selection of different crop types and sowing dates in response to A1B seasonal climate caused a reduction in heat stress impacts in some regions, which suggests that adaptive measures considering these management options may partially mitigate heat stress at local level. Our results indicate that temperate and sub-tropical agricultural areas might bear substantial crop yield losses due to extreme temperature episodes and they highlight the need to develop adaptation strategies and agricultural policies able to mitigate heat stress impacts on global food supply.},

In the selected years, the total estimated damages attributed to heatwaves amounted to 0.3‚Äì0.5\% of European gross domestic product (GDP). However, the identified losses were largely heterogeneous across space, consistently showing GDP impacts beyond 1\% in more vulnerable regions. Future projections indicate that by 2060 impacts might increase in Europe by a factor of almost five compared to the historical period 1981‚Äì2010 if no further mitigation or adaptation actions are taken, suggesting the presence of more pronounced effects in the regions where these damages are already acute.},

	abstract = {Extreme weather events in Europe are closely linked to anomalies of the atmospheric circulation and in particular to circulation features like cyclones and atmospheric blocking. In this study, this linkage is systematically characterised with the help of conditional cyclone and blocking frequencies during precipitation, wind gust and temperature extremes at various locations in Europe. Such conditional frequency fields can serve as a dynamical fingerprint of the extreme events and yield insights into their most important physical driving mechanisms. Precipitation extremes over the ocean and over flat terrain are shown to be closely related to cyclones in the vicinity and the associated dynamical lifting. For extreme precipitation over complex terrain, cyclone anomalies are found at more remote locations, favouring the flow of moist air towards the topography. Wind gust extremes are associated with cyclone and blocking anomalies in opposite directions, with the cyclones occurring mostly over the North and Baltic seas for extreme events in central Europe. This setting is associated with pronounced surface pressure gradients and thus high near-surface wind velocities. Hot temperature extremes in northern and central Europe typically occur in the vicinity of a blocking anticyclone, where subsidence and radiative forcing are strong. Over southern Europe, blocking anomalies are shifted more to the north or northeast, indicating a more important role of warm air advection. Large-scale flow conditions for cold extremes are similar at many locations in Europe, with blocking anomalies over the North Atlantic and northern Europe and cyclone anomalies southeast of the cold extreme, both contributing to the advection of cold air masses. This characterisation of synoptic-scale forcing mechanisms can be helpful for better understanding and anticipating weather extremes and their long-term changes.},

	abstract = {Robust conclusions regarding changes in the temperature distribution rely on the accuracy and reliability of the input datasets used. Differences between methodologies and datasets in previous studies add uncertainty when comparing and quantifying findings. Here, the authors investigate the sensitivity of assessing global and regional temperature variability and extremes over 1980‚Äì2014 in gridded datasets of daily temperature anomalies. A gridded in situ‚Äìbased dataset, Hadley Centre Global Historical Climatology Network‚ÄìDaily (HadGHCND), is compared against several commonly used reanalysis products by assessing both the entire distribution and the tails of the distribution. Empirical probability distribution functions show sensitivity to the input dataset when estimating aspects such as standard deviation and skewness, with the mean showing robust results for most regions, irrespective of dataset choice. Standard deviation is especially sensitive, with larger disagreements between datasets for some regions more than others, such as Africa and the Mediterranean region, and with larger differences in minimum temperatures compared with maximum temperatures. Estimates of extreme parameters also show sensitivity to dataset choice, particularly in the lower tails and for daily minimum temperature anomalies. Comparing changes in the means and the extremes of the temperature distributions, the cold extremes in the lower tails have been warming at a faster rate than the mean of the entire distribution for much of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, with warm extremes warming at a faster rate than the mean in some subtropical regions. These documented sensitivities call for caution when assessing changes in temperature variability and extremes, as dataset choice can have substantial effects on results.},

While it is clear that the event was extreme, it is not obvious whether other areas in the world have also experienced events so far outside their natural variability. Using a novel assessment of heat extremes, we investigate how extreme this event was in the global context. Characterizing the relative intensity of an event as the number of standard deviations from the mean, the western North America heat wave is remarkable, coming in at over four standard deviations. Throughout the globe, where we have reliable data, only five other heat waves were found to be more extreme since 1960. We find that in both reanalyses and climate projections, the statistical distribution of extremes increases through time, in line with the distribution mean shift due to climate change. Regions that, by chance, have not had a recent extreme heat wave may be less prepared for potentially imminent events.},

Judged by similarity with reanalyses, the new-generation models simulate the present-day temperature and precipitation extremes reasonably well. In line with previous CMIP simulations, the new simulations continue to project a large-scale picture of more frequent and more intense hot temperature extremes and precipitation extremes and vanishing cold extremes under continued global warming. Changes in temperature extremes outpace changes in global annual mean surface air temperature (GSAT) over most landmasses, while changes in precipitation extremes follow changes in GSAT globally at roughly the Clausius‚ÄìClapeyron rate of {\textasciitilde}7\% ¬∞C‚àí1. Changes in temperature and precipitation extremes normalized with respect to GSAT do not depend strongly on the choice of forcing scenario or model climate sensitivity, and do not vary strongly over time, but with notable regional variations. Over the majority of land regions, the projected intensity increases and relative frequency increases tend to be larger for more extreme hot temperature and precipitation events than for weaker events. To obtain robust estimates of these changes at local scales, large initial-condition ensemble simulations are needed. Appropriate spatial pooling of data from neighboring grid cells within individual simulations can, to some extent, reduce the needed ensemble size.},

	abstract = {Background
The on-going climate change is predicted to yield a growing number of extreme climate events which will increase in both intensity and frequency. Increased longevity is changing society's demographics. It is very likely this will have a direct impact on population health. Many studies have previously shown that the elderly in a society are among the most vulnerable to heat waves.
Objectives
With a rapidly growing number of publications on this subject the objective was to review the recent literature for research regarding the impact of heat waves and elevated temperature on the elderly with regards to mortality and morbidity.
Methods
PubMed was searched to identify studies published in English between 1st of January 2008 and 31st of December 2010 using the following key words: heat wave, mortality, morbidity, elderly and temperature. The relationship between high temperature and mortality and/or morbidity had to be studied. Results for the elderly had to be provided.
Results
Six studies of temperature‚Äìmorbidity-relationship were found and 24 studies of temperature‚Äìmortality-relationship. Studies consistently reported increases in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, as appeared also respiratory admissions to do during hot days and heat waves. However, the number of studies on morbidity published was much fewer. Few studies reported social, medical and environmental susceptibility factors.
Conclusions
Future research should focus on studying susceptibilities and to non-fatal events which are not as studied as mortality. Studies on the modification of type of urban environment, housing and mortality and morbidity in the elderly population are also needed.},

Methods: The authors conducted a case-crossover study in 50 US cities. They used daily mortality and weather data for 6 513 330 deaths occurring during 1989‚Äì2000. Exposure was assessed using two approaches. First, the authors determined exposure to extreme temperatures using city-specific indicator variables based on the local temperature distribution. Secondly, they used piecewise linear variables to assess exposure to temperature on a continuous scale above/below a threshold. Effects of hot and cold temperature were examined in season-specific models. In a meta-analysis of the city-specific results, the authors examined several city characteristics as effect modifiers.
Results: Mortality increases associated with both extreme cold (2-day cumulative increase 1.59\% (95\% CI 0.56 to 2.63)) and extreme heat (5.74\% (95\% CI 3.38 to 8.15)) were found, the former being especially marked for myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest deaths. The increase in mortality was less marked at less extreme temperatures. The effect of extreme cold (defined as a percentile) was homogeneous across cities with different climates, suggesting that only the unusualness of the cold temperature (and not its absolute value) had a substantial impact on mortality (that is, acclimatisation to cold). Conversely, heat effects were quite heterogeneous, with the largest effects observed in cities with milder summers, less air conditioning and higher population density. Adjustment for ozone led to similar results, but some residual confounding could be present due to other uncontrolled pollutants.
Conclusions: The authors confirmed in a large sample of cities that both cold and hot temperatures increase mortality risk. These findings suggest that increases in heat-related mortality due to global warming are unlikely to be compensated for by decreases in cold-related mortality and that population acclimatisation to heat is still incomplete.},

	abstract = {Climate extremes, such as droughts or heat waves, can lead to harvest failures and threaten the livelihoods of agricultural producers and the food security of communities worldwide. Improving our understanding of their impacts on crop yields is crucial to enhance the resilience of the global food system. This study analyses, to our knowledge for the first time, the impacts of climate extremes on yield anomalies of maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat at the global scale using sub-national yield data and applying a machine-learning algorithm. We find that growing season climate factors‚Äîincluding mean climate as well as climate extremes‚Äîexplain 20\%‚Äì49\% of the variance of yield anomalies (the range describes the differences between crop types), with 18\%‚Äì43\% of the explained variance attributable to climate extremes, depending on crop type. Temperature-related extremes show a stronger association with yield anomalies than precipitation-related factors, while irrigation partly mitigates negative effects of high temperature extremes. We developed a composite indicator to identify hotspot regions that are critical for global production and particularly susceptible to the effects of climate extremes. These regions include North America for maize, spring wheat and soy production, Asia in the case of maize and rice production as well as Europe for spring wheat production. Our study highlights the importance of considering climate extremes for agricultural predictions and adaptation planning and provides an overview of critical regions that are most susceptible to variations in growing season climate and climate extremes.},

	abstract = {Long-term warming trends across the globe have shifted the distribution of temperature variability, such that what was once classified as extreme heat relative to local mean conditions has become more common. This is also true for agricultural regions, where exposure to extreme heat, particularly during key growth phases such as the reproductive period, can severely damage crop production in ways that are not captured by most crop models. Here, we analyze exposure of crops to physiologically critical temperatures in the reproductive stage (Tcrit), across the global harvested areas of maize, rice, soybean and wheat. Trends for the 1980‚Äì2011 period show a relatively weak correspondence (r = 0.19) between mean growing season temperature and Tcrit exposure trends, emphasizing the importance of separate analyses for Tcrit. Increasing Tcrit exposure in the past few decades is apparent for wheat in Central and South Asia and South America, and for maize in many diverse locations across the globe. Maize had the highest percentage (15\%) of global harvested area exposed to at least five reproductive days over Tcrit in the 2000s, although this value is somewhat sensitive to the exact temperature used for the threshold. While there was relatively little sustained exposure to reproductive days over Tcrit for the other crops in the past few decades, all show increases with future warming. Using projections from climate models we estimate that by the 2030s, 31, 16, and 11\% respectively of maize, rice, and wheat global harvested area will be exposed to at least five reproductive days over Tcrit in a typical year, with soybean much less affected. Both maize and rice exhibit non-linear increases with time, with total area exposed for rice projected to grow from 8\% in the 2000s to 27\% by the 2050s, and maize from 15 to 44\% over the same period. While faster development should lead to earlier flowering, which would reduce reproductive extreme heat exposure for wheat on a global basis, this would have little impact for the other crops. Therefore, regardless of the impact of other global change factors (such as increasing atmospheric CO2), reproductive extreme heat exposure will pose risks for global crop production without adaptive measures such as changes in sowing dates, crop and variety switching, expansion of irrigation, and agricultural expansion into cooler areas.},

Here, we provide a comprehensive summary of this event and its impacts. Upstream diabatic heating played a key role in the magnitude of this anomaly. Weather forecasts provided advanced notice of the event, while sub-seasonal forecasts showed an increased likelihood of a heat extreme with lead times of 10-20 days. The impacts of this event were catastrophic, including hundreds of attributable deaths across the Pacific Northwest, mass-mortalities of marine life, reduced crop and fruit yields, river flooding from rapid snow and glacier melt, and a substantial increase in wildfires‚Äîthe latter contributing to landslides in the months following.

The control simulations are able to reproduce the spatial distributions and the daily evolutions for each of the three heat waves but apparently underestimate their amplitudes, intensities, and spatial extensions. The decreased ISM could cause an enhancement on heat waves with increased amplitudes, extents and intensities, while it has insignificant influence on the spatial distributions and temporal variations. The responses of heat waves are generally decreasing with the increasing ISM, controlled by different regimes in the surface soil moisture-temperature relationship. Through enhanced sensible flux as well as reduced latent cooling, the initial soil dryness locally strengthens the surface warming and the further drying of the soil. The three heat waves were all dominated by high-pressure systems in the mid-troposphere. The reduced ISM forces positive anomalies of geopotential height at mid-troposphere and negative anomalies at lower levels, leading to an enhanced thickness of the atmosphere. Such a thickened atmosphere can strengthen the anomalous high-pressure systems, favoring the maintenance of severe heat waves. This acts as a positive feedback between atmospheric circulation, surface warming, and soil dryness.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Currently, there are numerous studies for the Northern Hemisphere characterizing HWs and evaluating their impacts in several areas such as public health, economy, and agriculture. However, over South America, and in particular for Brazil, similar analysis is lacking despite its large geographical extension and numerous population potentially affected. Here we perform an assessment of HW events and characteristics recorded in six large Brazilian cities during the last five decades. The performed analysis reveals the existence of positive and significant trends in HW frequency since the 1980s, particularly for the cities of S√£o Paulo, Manaus, and Recife. Over the last decades, Bras√≠lia was the city that recorded the highest number of days per year under a HW regime, contrasting with Rio de Janeiro that recorded the lowest value. The assessment of the large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns associated with summer HWs, indicated for Porto Alegre, S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Bras√≠lia the presence of well-marked concentric and positive 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies followed by positive 850 hPa temperature anomalies. These anomalies are likely associated with quasi-stationary anticyclonic systems promoted by anomalous westward displacements of the South Atlantic Subtropical High System which are related to a weakening of other transients (and non-transient) systems such the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the South Atlantic Convergence Zone. For Manaus, the identified anomalies are linked to a northward displacement of the ITCZ. This configuration is compatible with an increase in solar radiative pattern and decreased soil moisture, enhancing surface temperature values, possibly associated with positive feedback mechanisms between soil and the atmosphere.},

Yet the processes triggering melt and causing its large interannual variability are not well understood. Here we show that melt onset over Arctic sea ice is initiated by positive anomalies of water vapor, clouds, and air temperatures that increase the downwelling longwave radiation (LWD) to the surface. The earlier melt onset occurs; the stronger are these anomalies. Downwelling shortwave radiation (SWD) is smaller than usual at melt onset, indicating that melt is not triggered by SWD. When melt occurs early, an anomalously opaque atmosphere with positive LWD anomalies preconditions the surface for weeks preceding melt. In contrast, when melt begins late, clearer than usual conditions are evident prior to melt. Hence, atmospheric processes are imperative for melt onset. It is also found that spring LWD increased during recent decades, consistent with trends toward an earlier melt onset.},

	abstract = {An extreme warming event near the North Pole, with 2 m temperature rising above 0 ¬∞C, was observed in late December 2015. This specific event has been attributed to cyclones and their associated moisture intrusions. However, little is known about the characteristics and drivers of similar events in the historical record. Here, using data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis, version 5 (ERA5), we study these winter extreme warming events with 2 m temperature over a grid point above 0 ¬∞C over the high Arctic (poleward of 80¬∞ N) that occurred during 1980‚Äì2021. In ERA5, such wintertime extreme warming events can only be found over the Atlantic sector. They occur rarely over many grid points, with a total absence during some winters. Furthermore, even when occurring, they tend to be short-lived, with the majority of the events lasting for less than a day. By examining their surface energy budget, we found that these events transition with increasing latitude from a regime dominated by turbulent heat flux into the one dominated by downward longwave radiation. Positive sea level pressure anomalies which resemble blocking over northern Eurasia are identified as a key ingredient in driving these events, as they can effectively deflect the eastward propagating cyclones poleward, leading to intense moisture and heat intrusions into the high Arctic. Using an atmospheric river (AR) detection algorithm, the roles of ARs in contributing to the occurrence of these extreme warming events defined at the grid-point scale are explicitly quantified. The importance of ARs in inducing these events increases with latitude. Poleward of about 83¬∞ N, 100 \% of these events occurred under AR conditions, corroborating that ARs were essential in contributing to the occurrence of these events. Over the past 4 decades, both the frequency, duration, and magnitude of these events have been increasing significantly. As the Arctic continues to warm, these events are likely to increase in both frequency, duration, and magnitude, with great implications for the local sea ice, hydrological cycle, and ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are expected to lead to more frequent and intense summer temperature extremes, not only due to the mean warming itself, but also due to changes in temperature variability. To test this hypothesis, we analyse daily output of ten PRUDENCE regional climate model scenarios over Europe for the 2071‚Äì2100 period. The models project more frequent temperature extremes particularly over the Mediterranean and the transitional climate zone (TCZ, between the Mediterranean to the south and the Baltic Sea to the north). The projected warming of the uppermost percentiles of daily summer temperatures is found to be largest over France (in the region of maximum variability increase) rather than the Mediterranean (where the mean warming is largest). The underlying changes in temperature variability may arise from changes in (1) interannual temperature variability, (2) intraseasonal variability, and (3) the seasonal cycle. We present a methodology to decompose the total daily variability into these three components. Over France and depending upon the model, the total daily summer temperature variability is projected to significantly increase by 20‚Äì40\% as a result of increases in all three components: interannual variability (30‚Äì95\%), seasonal variability (35‚Äì105\%), and intraseasonal variability (10‚Äì30\%). Variability changes in northern and southern Europe are substantially smaller. Over France and parts of the TCZ, the models simulate a progressive warming within the summer season (corresponding to an increase in seasonal variability), with the projected temperature change in August exceeding that in June by 2‚Äì3¬†K. Thus, the most distinct warming is superimposed upon the maximum of the current seasonal cycle, leading to a higher intensity of extremes and an extension of the summer period (enabling extreme temperatures and heat waves even in September). The processes driving the variability changes are different for the three components but generally relate to enhanced land‚Äìatmosphere coupling and/or increased variability of surface net radiation, accompanied by a strong reduction of cloudiness, atmospheric circulation changes and a progressive depletion of soil moisture within the summer season. The relative contribution of these processes differs substantially between models.},

These hot spots indicate where the warm tail of a distribution of temperatures increases faster than the average and are robust across most Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models. Exploring the conditions on the specific day when the hot extreme occurs demonstrates that the hot spots are explained by changes in the surface energy fluxes consistent with drying soils. However, the model-simulated accelerated warming of hot extremes appears inconsistent with observations, except over Europe. The simulated acceleration of hot extremes may therefore be unreliable, a result that necessitates a reevaluation of how climate models resolve the relevant terrestrial processes.},

	abstract = {Land-atmosphere interactions play an important role for hot temperature extremes in Europe. Dry soils may amplify such extremes through feedbacks with evapotranspiration. While previous observational studies generally focused on the relationship between precipitation deficits and the number of hot days, we investigate here the influence of soil moisture (SM) on summer monthly maximum temperatures (TXx) using water balance model-based SM estimates (driven with observations) and temperature observations. Generalized extreme value distributions are fitted to TXx using SM as a covariate. We identify a negative relationship between SM and TXx, whereby a 100mm decrease in model-based SM is associated with a 1.6¬∞C increase in TXx in Southern-Central and Southeastern Europe. Dry SM conditions result in a 2‚Äì4¬∞C increase in the 20-year return value of TXx compared to wet conditions in these two regions. In contrast with SM impacts on the number of hot days (NHD), where low and high surface-moisture conditions lead to different variability, we find a mostly linear dependency of the 20-year return value on surface-moisture conditions. We attribute this difference to the non-linear relationship between TXx and NHD that stems from the threshold-based calculation of NHD. Furthermore the employed SM data and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) are only weakly correlated in the investigated regions, highlighting the importance of evapotranspiration and runoff for resulting SM. Finally, in a case study for the hot 2003 summer we illustrate that if 2003 spring conditions in Southern-Central Europe had been as dry as in the more recent 2011 event, temperature extremes in summer would have been higher by about 1¬∞C, further enhancing the already extreme conditions which prevailed in that year.},

All regional model integrations, carried out in the PRUDENCE project, use the same boundaries of the HadAM3H global atmospheric model. Compared to the CRU TS 2.0 observational data set most RCMs (but not all) overpredict the temperature variability significantly in their control simulation. The behaviour of the different regional climate models is analysed in terms of the surface energy budget, and the contributions of the different terms in the surface energy budget to the temperature variability are estimated. This analysis shows a clear relation in the model ensemble between temperature variability and the combined effects of downward long wave, net short wave radiation and evaporation (defined as F). However, it appears that the overestimation of the temperature variability has no unique cause. The effect of short-wave radiation dominates in some RCMs, whereas in others the effect of evaporation dominates. In all models the temperature variability and F increase when imposing future climate boundary conditions, with particularly high values in central Europe.},

	abstract = {The decadal variability of extreme high temperature (EHT) in the mid and highlatitudes of continental Asia (MHLCA) and associated mechanisms were investigated. Observational analysis indicated that, after removing global warming, the first leading mode of the EHT events showed a meridional dipole pattern and had significant decadal variability. During the periods 1980‚Äì1994 and 2012‚Äì2019 (1995‚Äì2011), EHT events were more frequent and stronger (less frequent and weaker) in western-central Siberia than normal, whereas they were less frequent and weaker (more frequent and stronger) in the wide area to the south of Lake Baikal. Further Observational and CESM (Community Earth System Model) results based analysis suggested that decadal change in air‚Äìsea interaction in the North Atlantic play an important role in shaping the decadal variability of EHT events in MHLCA. On decadal timescales, meridional negative‚Äìpositive‚Äìnegative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North Atlantic and their coupled positive North Atlantic Oscillation can trigger stronger wave activity flux and cause a significant anticyclonic‚Äìcyclonic teleconnection wave train in the troposphere over the mid and high latitudes of the Eurasian continent. As a result, an anomalous high-pressure center is evident in western-central Siberia, and thereby reducing total cloud cover and causing stronger solar heating. Thus, EHT events become more frequent and stronger. On the contrary, for the areas south of Lake Baikal, EHT events are weakened by corresponding cyclonic circulation anomalies. Additionally, the CAM5 (Community Atmosphere Model version 5) experiments suggested more important driving role of the decadal North Atlantic tripole SST anomalies in the abovementioned processes.},

	abstract = {The occurrence of very high temperatures (hot extremes) is often linked with negative impacts in human health, natural ecosystems and the economy (e.g., energy, water supply and agriculture). Studies have invariably shown that the intensity and frequency of hot extremes will increase in the future thus increasing their associated risks. While much progress has been made in quantifying and understanding hot temperature extremes and their future changes, there are still open questions. This paper focusses on the sources of hot extremes and their changes by applying a simple and unambiguous methodology that describes daily hot extremes as the superposition of four well known physical terms that include information on the annual mean temperature, the amplitude of the annual cycle, the diurnal temperature range and the local temperature anomaly on the day of the extreme. The methodology was applied to 30-year daily temperature records from 6 observation-based datasets and 31¬†atmosphere-ocean global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The comparison between observed and simulated hot extremes shows a remarkably consistent picture where most CMIP5 models overestimate the term describing the local temperature extreme anomaly over most regions of the globe regardless of the observed dataset considered. Simultaneously, CMIP5 models show a systematic cold bias in the annual mean temperature and in the diurnal temperature range terms leading to substantial error compensation over some regions. This prompted us to define a new error estimator as the sum of errors in individual terms that appears to be much more effective at characterising model's performance compared to the traditional bias estimator. The assessment of future changes in hot extremes shows that changes are dominated by changes in annual mean temperatures with varying contributions from the other terms that strongly depend on the specific region being considered. Western Europe appears as a hot spot for extreme temperature changes (increases of {\textasciitilde}8 ‚àòC by the end of the century) due to significant contributions from all decomposition terms including the summer mean anomaly, the diurnal temperature range and the daily extreme anomaly. Tropical South America also appears as a hot spot for extreme temperature changes (increases of {\textasciitilde}7 ‚àòC) largely due to an increase in the daily extreme anomaly term (explaining about 30\% of the full change) making this region one of the most sensitive regions in the world in terms of hot extremes. The analysis reveals that the separation of future changes according to terms describing mean, variability and tails is very sensitive to the specific way the mean component is defined including assumptions about stationarity.},

	abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is an essential paradigm in Earth and Environmental Systems modeling. However, the term ‚Äúsensitivity‚Äù has a clear definition, based in partial derivatives, only when specified locally around a particular point (e.g., optimal solution) in the problem space. Accordingly, no unique definition exists for ‚Äúglobal sensitivity‚Äù across the problem space, when considering one or more model responses to different factors such as model parameters or forcings. A variety of approaches have been proposed for global sensitivity analysis, based on different philosophies and theories, and each of these formally characterizes a different ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù understanding of sensitivity. These approaches focus on different properties of the model response at a fundamental level and may therefore lead to different (even conflicting) conclusions about the underlying sensitivities. Here we revisit the theoretical basis for sensitivity analysis, summarize and critically evaluate existing approaches in the literature, and demonstrate their flaws and shortcomings through conceptual examples. We also demonstrate the difficulty involved in interpreting ‚Äúglobal‚Äù interaction effects, which may undermine the value of existing interpretive approaches. With this background, we identify several important properties of response surfaces that are associated with the understanding and interpretation of sensitivities in the context of Earth and Environmental System models. Finally, we highlight the need for a new, comprehensive framework for sensitivity analysis that effectively characterizes all of the important sensitivity-related properties of model response surfaces.},

Warming of extreme temperatures is amplified over land, with severe implications for human health, wildfire risk and food production. Using simulations from 18 climate models, I show that hot days over tropical land warm substantially more than the average day. For example, warming of the hottest 5\% of land days is a factor of 1.21‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.07 larger than the time-mean warming averaged across models. The climate change response of extreme temperatures over tropical land is interpreted using a theory based on atmospheric dynamics. According to the theory, warming is amplified for hot land days because those days are dry, which is termed the ‚Äòdrier get hotter‚Äô mechanism. Changes in near-surface relative humidity further increase tropical land warming, with decreases in land relative humidity being particularly important. The theory advances physical understanding of the tropical climate and highlights land surface dryness as a key factor determining how extreme temperatures respond to climate change.},

Applying this framework to near-surface and free-tropospheric T‚Ä≤ associated with the record-shattering 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest shows that ascending, diabatic air streams in North Pacific cyclones contribute more than 50\% of free-tropospheric T‚Ä≤, whereas near-surface T‚Ä≤ is mainly produced by local subsidence and diabatic heating with only marginal upstream contributions. Since free-tropospheric T‚Ä≤ facilitates near-surface accumulation of locally produced T‚Ä≤ by rendering the atmosphere stable to moist convection, our findings corroborate the notion of top-down induced heatwave formation fueled by upstream diabatic processes.},

	abstract = {Since temperature extremes have a strong impact on environment and society, it is crucial to understand their underlying mechanisms. While their relationship to the large-scale atmospheric circulation has been comprehensively investigated, the role of physical processes in the formation of air masses with extreme temperatures is less well understood. This study presents a Lagrangian analysis of the 0.1\% most extreme six-hourly hot and cold events in three European regions (UK, Central Europe, Balkans) for the time period 1989‚Äì2009. The results provide insight into typical transport patterns and physical processes (adiabatic compression, radiation, surface heat fluxes) occurring along the trajectories of extreme temperature air masses. Cold events in Europe are most frequently induced by advection of cold air masses from the Arctic and Russia. The transport to the target region is characterized by a temperature increase caused by adiabatic compression and, in the maritime setting of the UK, also by diabatic heating due to surface sensible heat fluxes. Despite the warming along the trajectories, the extremeness of the associated 2 m temperature increases, due to the dislocation of the air mass to regions with a milder climate. Hot events are generally associated with weaker horizontal transport, but strong adiabatic warming and local temperature increase caused by enhanced radiation and surface heat fluxes. This in situ warming is particularly strong in Central Europe. Evaluating the temperature evolution along the trajectories reveals that hot and cold extremes develop on a similar time-scale of 2‚Äì3 days. This time-scale is mostly set by physical processes for hot extremes and controlled by advective transport for cold extremes. The diagnostics applied in this study lead to an improved process understanding that can provide a basis for more accurate predictions of temperature extremes.},

	abstract = {Lagrangian trajectories are widely used in the atmospheric sciences, for instance to identify flow structures in extratropical cyclones (e.g., warm conveyor belts) and long-range transport pathways of moisture and trace substances. Here a new version of the Lagrangian analysis tool LAGRANTO (Wernli and Davies, 1997) is introduced, which offers considerably enhanced functionalities. Trajectory starting positions can be defined easily and flexibly based on different geometrical and/or meteorological conditions, e.g., equidistantly spaced within a prescribed region and on a stack of pressure (or isentropic) levels. After the computation of the trajectories, a versatile selection of trajectories is offered based on single or combined criteria. These criteria are passed to LAGRANTO with a simple command language (e.g., "GT:PV:2" readily translates into a selection of all trajectories with potential vorticity, PV, greater than 2 PVU; 1 PVU = 10‚àí6 K m2 kg‚àí1 s‚àí1). Full versions of this new version of LAGRANTO are available for global ECMWF and regional COSMO data, and core functionality is provided for the regional WRF and MetUM models and the global 20th Century Reanalysis data set. The paper first presents the intuitive application of LAGRANTO for the identification of a warm conveyor belt in the North Atlantic. A further case study then shows how LAGRANTO can be used to quasi-operationally diagnose stratosphere‚Äìtroposphere exchange events. Whereas these examples rely on the ECMWF version, the COSMO version and input fields with 7 km horizontal resolution serve to resolve the rather complex flow structure associated with orographic blocking due to the Alps, as shown in a third example. A final example illustrates the tool's application in source‚Äìreceptor analysis studies. The new distribution of LAGRANTO is publicly available and includes auxiliary tools, e.g., to visualize trajectories. A detailed user guide describes all LAGRANTO capabilities.},

	abstract = {Although heat waves account for more premature deaths in the Australian region than any other natural disaster, an understanding of their dynamics is still incomplete. The present study identifies the dynamical mechanisms responsible for heat waves in southeastern Australia using 10-day backward trajectories computed from the ERA-Interim reanalyses. Prior to the formation of a heat wave, trajectories located over the south Indian Ocean and over Australia in the lower and midtroposphere ascend diabatically ahead of an upper-level trough and over a baroclinic zone to the south of the continent. These trajectories account for 44\% of all trajectories forming the anticyclonic upper-level potential vorticity anomalies that characterize heat waves in the region. At the same time, trajectories located over the south Indian Ocean in the lower part of the troposphere descend and aggregate over the Tasman Sea. This descent is accompanied by a strong adiabatic warming. A key finding is that the temperatures are raised further through diabatic heating in the boundary layer over eastern Australia but not over the inner Australian continent. From eastern Australia, the air parcels are advected southward as they become incorporated into the near-surface anticyclone that defines the heat wave. In contrast to past studies, the importance of cloud-diabatic processes in the evolution of the midlatitude large-scale flow and the role of adiabatic compression in elevating the near-surface temperatures is emphasized. Likewise, the role of the local surface sensible heat fluxes is deemphasized.},

	abstract = {Even though meteorologists have been aware of atmospheric blocking for more than 100 years, it is a phenomenon still not well forecast or completely understood. Also, while there is not one standard accepted definition, there are some commonalities known about the understanding of blocking behavior. Blocking occurs less often than other destructive phenomena, but globally their occurrence has increased since the beginning of the century. The longevity of blocking means it can negatively impact agricultural and economic activity and human comfort by bringing extreme conditions not only to the areas where they occur but also to locations well upstream and downstream. Additionally, while it is known where blocking occurs and their general character has been well described, operational models still struggle to replicate the intensity and duration even though improvement has been noted in the timing and location of onset. Climatologically, models still underestimate their occurrence. In the last 40 years, investigators have used case study analysis and numerical and theoretical models to understand the onset and maintenance of blocking. Comparatively few have examined block decay. This review endeavors to cover the highlights of the history of blocking investigations, especially in the last few decades, in order to provide an understanding for a more general scientific audience.},

	abstract = {The physical understanding and timely prediction of extreme weather events are of enormous importance to society due to their associated impacts. In this article, we highlight several types of weather extremes occurring in Europe in connection with a particular atmospheric flow pattern, known as atmospheric blocking. This flow pattern effectively blocks the prevailing westerly large-scale atmospheric flow, resulting in changing flow anomalies in the vicinity of the blocking system and persistent conditions in the immediate region of its occurrence. Blocking systems are long-lasting, quasi-stationary and self-sustaining systems that occur frequently over certain regions. Their presence and characteristics have an impact on the predictability of weather extremes and can thus be used as potential indicators. The phasing between the surface and the upper-level blocking anomalies is of major importance for the development of the extreme event. In summer, heat waves and droughts form below the blocking anticyclone primarily via large-scale subsidence that leads to cloud-free skies and, thus, persistent shortwave radiative warming of the ground. In winter, cold waves that occur during atmospheric blocking are normally observed downstream or south of these systems. Here, meridional advection of cold air masses from higher latitudes plays a decisive role. Depending on their location, blocking systems also may lead to a shift in the storm track, which influences the occurrence of wind and precipitation anomalies. Due to these multifaceted linkages, compound events are often observed in conjunction with blocking conditions. In addition to the aforementioned relations, the predictability of extreme events associated with blocking and links to climate change are assessed. Finally, current knowledge gaps and pertinent research perspectives for the future are discussed.},

We derived these products using data from a variety of sources, including many substantial surveys completed since the original Bedmap compilation (Bedmap1) in 2001. In particular, the Bedmap2 ice thickness grid is made from 25 million measurements, over two orders of magnitude more than were used in Bedmap1. In most parts of Antarctica the subglacial landscape is visible in much greater detail than was previously available and the improved data-coverage has in many areas revealed the full scale of mountain ranges, valleys, basins and troughs, only fragments of which were previously indicated in local surveys. The derived statistics for Bedmap2 show that the volume of ice contained in the Antarctic ice sheet (27 million km3) and its potential contribution to sea-level rise (58 m) are similar to those of Bedmap1, but the mean thickness of the ice sheet is 4.6\% greater, the mean depth of the bed beneath the grounded ice sheet is 72 m lower and the area of ice sheet grounded on bed below sea level is increased by 10\%. The Bedmap2 compilation highlights several areas beneath the ice sheet where the bed elevation is substantially lower than the deepest bed indicated by Bedmap1. These products, along with grids of data coverage and uncertainty, provide new opportunities for detailed modelling of the past and future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets.},

	abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

	abstract = {The occurrence of recent summer temperature extremes in the midlatitudes has raised questions about whether and how the distributions of summer temperature are changing. While it is clear that in most regions the average temperature is increasing, there is less consensus regarding the presence or nature of changes in the shape of the distributions, which can influence the probability of extreme events. Using data from over 4000 weather stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily database, we quantify the changes in daily maximum and minimum temperature distributions for peak summer in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes during 1980‚Äì2015 using quantile regression. A large majority (87‚Äì88\%) of the trends across percentiles and stations can be explained by a shift of the distributions with no change in shape. The remaining variability is summarized through projections onto orthogonal basis functions that are closely related to changes in variance, skewness, and kurtosis. North America and Eurasia show significant shifts in the estimated distributions of daily maximum and minimum temperatures. Although no general change in summer variance is found, variance has regionally increased in Eurasia and decreased in most of North America. Changes in shape that project onto the skewness and kurtosis basis functions have a much smaller spatial scale and are generally insignificant.},

Changes in extreme anomalous daily temperatures are determined by fitting extreme value distributions with time-varying parameters. Changes in the distribution of anomaly exceedances above a high threshold are found to be statistically significant at the 10\% level for most land areas when compared with a time-invariant distribution and with the unforced natural variability produced by a coupled climate model. The largest positive trends in the location parameter of the extreme distribution are found in Canada and Eurasia where daily maximum temperatures have typically warmed by 1 to 3¬∞C since 1950. The total area exhibiting positive trends is significantly greater than can be attributed to unforced natural variability. For most regions, positive trend magnitudes are larger and cover a greater area for daily minimum temperatures than for maximum temperatures. The comparatively small areas of cooling are found to be consistent with unforced natural climate variability. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is found to have a significant influence on extreme winter daily temperatures for many areas, with a negative NAO of one standard deviation reducing expected extreme winter daily temperatures by ‚àº2¬∞C over Eurasia but increasing temperatures over northeastern North America.},

	abstract = {Warming of the climate system can result in very large corresponding changes in the occurrence of climate extremes. Temperature extremes may occur due to a shift in the whole distribution, where there is an increase in the entire temperature probability distribution, or to changes in the shape of the distribution, such as an increase in variability causing a widening of the distribution. Understanding the precise characteristics of changes in temperature distributions in response to background warming is an important aspect of fully understanding changes in heat extremes and their associated impacts on human and ecosystem health. This study investigates projected 21st century changes in the characteristics of mean, maximum and minimum temperature on daily- and annual- timescales for various regions (Australia, Asia, Europe and North America) using data from seven models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 5 (CMIP5). Using the RCP8.5 experiment we show that an increase in mean temperature throughout the 21st century is a consistent feature of all models for each region. Changes in the variance of simulated temperatures are equivocal, with the sign and magnitude of variance changes in the 21st century varying in different models and regions. A quantile regression analysis demonstrates differences in upper and lower quantile slopes, relative to the mean, including a consistent skew in daily temperatures towards hot extremes. These potentially complex characteristics of temperature changes should not be overlooked, as temperature extremes are potentially more sensitive to changes in the variance and higher order moments than in the mean. Furthermore, a wider range of extreme temperature behaviour may have important consequences for various stakeholders, due to impacts on public health, agriculture and ecological systems.},

Diabatic cooling dominates TN1day anomalies in the climatologically coldest regions, while advection forms TN1day anomalies over most ocean regions. Over most extratropical land masses, TN1day anomalies arise from a combination of both processes. The mean age and formation distance of TN1day anomalies vary strongly in space, from one to 8 days, and 500‚Äì5,500 km, respectively. Five distinct types of TN1day events are identified from these physical and spatio-temporal characteristics, and their geographical occurrence is investigated. Furthermore, advective, adiabatic and diabatic contributions typically cancel each other partially, but less so for the most intense TN1day events, which occur when the atmosphere's ability to dampen near-surface temperature anomalies is limited.},

	abstract = {Airborne dust represents a hazard to the environment and human health. The outflow of air masses carrying dust from northern Africa, the world's largest active dust source, to the North Atlantic and Mediterranean regions is modulated by atmospheric conditions. However, how global warming-driven changes on atmospheric circulation have influenced North African air outflow in the recent past is not well understood. Here, we explore the Saharan air outflow from northwestern Africa over the 1980 to 2020 period. We find a decrease in the transport to the Atlantic Ocean and the Iberian Peninsula of ‚àí0.29 ¬± 0.16\% dec‚àí1 and -0.66 ¬± 0.18\% dec‚àí1, respectively, and an increasing trend to the Mediterranean Sea (0.24 ¬± 0.18\% dec‚àí1) and Europe (0.60 ¬± 0.18\% dec‚àí1). The results indicate that the strengthening of the Atlantic high pressure system and the Saharan thermal low, both associated with the narrowing of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the Hadley Cell expansion under global warming, could be favoring the Saharan outflow to the Mediterranean Sea and Europe in detriment of transport to the Atlantic Ocean. The results also show that present-day Saharan air arrives at these regions at higher altitudes and in shorter timescales than decades ago. This is associated to the increase in surface heating conditions in the Sahara, 0.41 ¬± 0.02 ¬∞C dec‚àí1, that can inject air into windier upper atmospheric levels, thereby allowing higher and faster air transport. Our results suggest a change in the Saharan air outflow likely associated with global warming and with potentially significant implications for the temporal and spatial patterns of North African dust export.},

However, amplification mechanisms are highly uncertain because of the complex interplay between regional physical responses to human forcing and the statistical properties of atmospheric temperatures. Here, focusing on the latter, we explain how and to what extent the leading moments of thermal distributions sway the future trajectories of heat extremes. Crucially, we show that daily temperature variability is the key to understanding global patterns of change in the frequency and severity of the extremes and their exacerbation in many places. Variability accounts for at least half of the highly differential regional sensitivities and may well outweigh the background warming. These findings provide fundamental insights for assessing the reliability of climate models and improving their future projections.},

	volume = {57},
	abstract = {Extreme summer temperatures have a significant impact on Australasia, and these are expected to intensify with global warming. The simulation of these extremes, particularly near coasts, is limited by the modest resolution of global climate models such as the CSIRO Mk3.0. We examine the temperatures simulated by the regional model CCAM, at a resolution of around 0.5¬∞, downscaled from Mk3.0 simulations. Extremes for three periods, from monthly to decadal, are presented. The distribution of daily temperatures in summer is characterised by a large variation of standard deviation (SD) across the region, peaking along the southern Australian coast. The distribution is positively skewed along most coasts, and negatively skewed in the interior. There are strong correlations with daily winds. The projected mean warming over the 21st century for the A1B greenhouse gas scenario reaches 3¬∞C in the Australian interior, but barely half that on the south coast, as anticipated from the smaller rate of warming of the surrounding seas. There is rather little moderation of warming on the east and west coasts, however. Warming over New Zealand and New Guinea is typically 2¬∞C, for both means and extremes, some 50 per cent larger than that of the oceans. The SD of temperature anomalies increases over much of Australia, while skewness increases on some coasts. Both SD and skewness decrease in the southeast. Changes in the extremes, relative to the means, relate to those in both measures. This is demonstrated using a beta distribution fit to local daily temperature distributions. At many locations, changes in extremes cannot be accurately estimated from a simple shift of the distribution. Much of the pattern of change is related to the effect of wind variability over the enhanced land-sea contrasts, as shown using a simple model for the influence of wind.},

	abstract = {Currently, most real-world time series datasets are multivariate and are rich in dynamical information of the underlying system. Such datasets are attracting much attention; therefore, the need for accurate modelling of such high-dimensional datasets is increasing. Recently, the deep architecture of the recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variant long short-term memory (LSTM) have been proven to be more accurate than traditional statistical methods in modelling time series data. Despite the reported advantages of the deep LSTM model, its performance in modelling multivariate time series (MTS) data has not been satisfactory, particularly when attempting to process highly non-linear and long-interval MTS datasets. The reason is that the supervised learning approach initializes the neurons randomly in such recurrent networks, disabling the neurons that ultimately must properly learn the latent features of the correlated variables included in the MTS dataset. In this paper, we propose a pre-trained LSTM-based stacked autoencoder (LSTM-SAE) approach in an unsupervised learning fashion to replace the random weight initialization strategy adopted in deep LSTM recurrent networks. For evaluation purposes, two different case studies that include real-world datasets are investigated, where the performance of the proposed approach compares favourably with the deep LSTM approach. In addition, the proposed approach outperforms several reference models investigating the same case studies. Overall, the experimental results clearly show that the unsupervised pre-training approach improves the performance of deep LSTM and leads to better and faster convergence than other models.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews and advocates against the use of permute-and-predict (PaP) methods for interpreting black box functions. Methods such as the variable importance measures proposed for random forests, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectation plots remain popular because they are both model-agnostic and depend only on the pre-trained model output, making them computationally efficient and widely available in software. However, numerous studies have found that these tools can produce diagnostics that are highly misleading, particularly when there is strong dependence among features. The purpose of our work here is to (i) review this growing body of literature, (ii) provide further demonstrations of these drawbacks along with a detailed explanation as to why they occur, and (iii) advocate for alternative measures that involve additional modeling. In particular, we describe how breaking dependencies between features in hold-out data places undue emphasis on sparse regions of the feature space by forcing the original model to extrapolate to regions where there is little to no data. We explore these effects across various model setups and find support for previous claims in the literature that PaP metrics can vastly over-emphasize correlated features in both variable importance measures and partial dependence plots. As an alternative, we discuss and recommend more direct approaches that involve measuring the change in model performance after muting the effects of the features under investigation.},

Artificial Intelligence-based models have been widely used in air quality forecasting. The Shallow Multi-output Long Short-Term Memory (SM-LSTM) model is suitable for regional multi-step-ahead air quality forecasting, while it commonly encounters spatio-temporal instabilities and time-lag effects. To overcome these bottlenecks and overfitting issues, this study proposed a Deep Multi-output LSTM (DM-LSTM) neural network model that were incorporated with three deep learning algorithms (i.e., mini-batch gradient descent, dropout neuron and L2 regularization) to configure the model for extracting the key factors of complex spatio-temporal relations as well as reducing error accumulation and propagation in multi-step-ahead air quality forecasting. The proposed DM-LSTM model was evaluated by three time series of PM2.5, PM10, and NOx simultaneously at five air quality monitoring stations in Taipei City of Taiwan. Results indicated that the loss function values (mean-square-error) of the SM-LSTM and DM-LSTM models in the testing stages at horizon t+4 were 0.87 and 0.72, respectively. The Gbench values of the DM-LSTM model in the testing stages for PM2.5, PM10, and NOx reached 0.95¬†at horizon t+1 and exceeded 0.81¬†at horizon t+4, respectively. Results demonstrated that the proposed DM-LSTM model incorporated with three deep learning algorithms could significantly improve the spatio-temporal stability and accuracy of regional multi-step-ahead air quality forecasts.},

The latest generation of climate model projections, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Six (CMIP6), provides a new and improved database to investigate change in future daily scale extreme temperature events. This study examines the changes in 1, 3, and 5 day averaged annual maximum temperature in four large CMIP6 ensembles. It analyses, using a generalized extreme value (GEV) method, the change in extreme daily mean temperatures at 1.5 and 2¬∞C of global warming, levels highlighted by the 2016 Paris Agreement, and additionally at 3¬∞C. Extremely hot events are characterized using the annual maxima of daily near surface air temperature in the SSP370 scenario. Global changes in the mode of the distributions (location parameter) follow long-term summer warming and show very similar spatial patterns. Changes in variability (scale parameter) show a clear trend of increases over the tropics and decreases over higher latitudes, while changes to the tails of distributions (shape parameter) show less globally consistent trends but clear signals over the Arctic sea ice, behaviour also seen in variability. Risk ratios (RRs) indicating the change in probability of hot daily extremes that currently have a 10 year return period increase globally with mean temperature change, with greater increases over the tropics. Globally averaged changes in RR over land range from 3.1‚Äì3.6 to 7.9‚Äì8.3 for 1.5 and 3¬∞C of warming, respectively. For the latter case, this indicates previously rare, once-in-a-decade summer extremes will occur almost annually in the future under high warming.},

Developing predictive models plays an important role in interpreting complex real-world elements. With the sharp increase in the quantity and dimensionality of data, new challenges, such as extracting deep features and recognizing deep latent patterns, have emerged, demanding novel approaches and effective solutions. Deep learning, composed of multiple processing layers to learn with multiple levels of abstraction, is, now, commonly deployed for overcoming the newly arisen difficulties. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art developments in deep learning for time series prediction. Based on modeling for the perspective of conditional or joint probability, we categorize them into discriminative, generative, and hybrids models. Experiments are implemented on both benchmarks and real-world data to elaborate the performance of the representative deep learning-based prediction methods.

As a result, the analysis and prediction of air pollution has attracted a good deal of interest among researchers. The research areas include traditional machine learning, neural networks and deep learning. How to effectively and accurately predict air pollution becomes an important issue. In this paper, we propose an Aggregated LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model (ALSTM) based on the LSTM deep learning method. In this new model, we combine local air quality monitoring station, the station in nearby industrial areas, and the stations for external pollution sources. To improve prediction accuracy, we aggregate three LSTM models into a predictive model for early predictions based on external sources of pollution and information from nearby industrial air quality stations. We exploited the data with 17 attributes collected by Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency from 2012 to 2017 as the training data to build the ALSTM forecasting model, and we tested the model using the data collected in 2018. We conducted some experiments to compare our new ALSTM model with SVR (Support Vector Machine based Regression), GBTR (Gradient Boosted Tree Regression), LSTM, etc., in the prediction of PM2.5 for 1‚Äì8¬†h, and evaluated them using various assessment techniques, such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. The results reveal that the proposed aggregated model can effectively improve the accuracy of prediction.},

The exact cause and effect relations among variables involved in weather forecasting are not tangible for the long range and they require some discovery. This makes prediction of weather in the distant future i.e., greater than 7-10 days a huge challenge. In this paper, we propose the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks in order to predict the weather condition so that the model can better decide what to retain what to forget. Combining this with optimizations such as Gaussian and Median filtering has resulted in better accuracy in the long range as the model formed a much more informed pattern.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

These record-shattering extremes, nearly impossible in the absence of warming, are likely to occur in the coming decades. We demonstrate that their probability of occurrence depends on warming rate, rather than global warming level, and is thus pathway-dependent. In high-emission scenarios, week-long heat extremes that break records by three or more standard deviations are two to seven times more probable in 2021‚Äì2050 and three to 21 times more probable in 2051‚Äì2080, compared to the last three decades.

However, for the forecasts initialized earlier than June 17, not a single ensemble member of all the models is able to capture the magnitude of the observed temperature anomaly.

It is shown that over large parts of the high-latitude continents warm temperature extremes often occur simultaneously with atmospheric blocking at the same location. Taking also weak blocks into account, more than 80\% of the six-hourly warm extremes are associated with blocking, e.g., in eastern Canada, Scandinavia and parts of Siberia. On the contrary, cold extremes typically are not related to co-located atmospheric blocking. This difference between warm and cold extremes points to differences also in the physical driving mechanisms of the extremes. The strong linkage of warm temperature extremes and blocking should be considered when investigating changes of temperature extremes with global warming.},

	abstract = {Blocking occurrence and its impacts on European temperature have been studied in the last decade. However, most previous studies on blocking impacts have focused on winter only, disregarding its fingerprint in summer and differences with other synoptic patterns that also trigger temperature extremes. In this work, we provide a clear distinction between high-latitude blocking and sub-tropical ridges occurring in three sectors of the Euro-Atlantic region, describing their climatology and consequent impacts on European temperature during both winter and summer. Winter blocks (ridges) are generally associated to colder (warmer) than average conditions over large regions of Europe, in some areas with anomalies larger than 5¬†¬∞C, particularly for the patterns occurring in the Atlantic and Central European sectors. During summer, there is a more regional response characterized by above average temperature for both blocking and ridge patterns, especially those occurring in continental areas, although negative temperature anomalies persist in southernmost areas during blocking. An objective analysis of the different forcing mechanisms associated to each considered weather regime has been performed, quantifying the importance of the following processes in causing the temperature anomalies: horizontal advection, vertical advection and diabatic heating. While during winter advection processes tend to be more relevant to explain temperature responses, in summer radiative heating under enhanced insolation plays a crucial role for both blocking and ridges. Finally, the changes in the distributions of seasonal temperature and in the frequencies of extreme temperature indices were also examined for specific areas of Europe. Winter blocking and ridge patterns are key drivers in the occurrence of regional cold and warm extreme temperatures, respectively. In summer, they are associated with substantial changes in the frequency of extremely warm days, but with different signatures in southern Europe. We conclude that there has been some misusage of the traditional blocking definition in the attribution of extreme events.},

A 50-member ensemble of the second generation Canadian Earth System Model is used to quantify the role of internal variability in the response to blocking. We find that the present blocking-extreme temperature link is well represented compared to ERA-Interim, despite a significant underestimation of blocking frequency in most ensemble members. Our results show a strong correlation of blocking with northern European HWs in summer, spring, and fall. However, we also find a strong anticorrelation between blocking and HW occurrence in southern Europe in all seasons. Blocking increases the CS frequency particularly in southern Europe in fall, winter, and spring but reduces it in summer. For the future we find that blocking will continue to play an important role in the development of both CSs and HWs in all seasons.},

	abstract = {This paper brings a new perspective on the large scale dynamics of severe heat wave (HW) events that commonly affect southern Australia. Through an automatic tracking scheme, the cyclones and anticyclones associated with HWs affecting Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth are tracked at both the surface and upper levels, producing for the first time a synoptic climatology that reveals the broader connections associated with these extreme phenomena. The results show that a couplet (or pressure dipole) formed by transient cyclones and anticyclones can reinforce the HW similarly to what is observed in cold surges (CS), with an obvious opposite polarity. Our results show that there is a large degree of mobility in the synoptic signature associated with the passage of the upper level ridges before they reach Australia and the blocking is established, with HW-associated surface anticyclones often initiating over the west Indian Ocean and decaying in the eastern Pacific. In contrast to this result the 500¬†hPa anticyclone tracks show a very small degree of mobility, responding to the dominance of the upper level blocking ridge. An important feature of HWs is that most of the cyclones are formed inland in association with heat troughs, while in CS the cyclones are typically maritime (often explosive), associated with a strong cold front. Hence the influence of the cyclone is indirect, contributing to reinforce the blocking ridge through hot and dry advection on the ridge‚Äôs western flank. Additional insights are drawn for the record Adelaide case of March 2008 with fifteen consecutive days above 35¬∞C breaking the previous record by 7¬†days. Sea surface temperatures suggest a significant air-sea interaction mechanism, with a broad increase in the meridional temperature gradient over the Indian Ocean amplifying the upstream Rossby waves that can trigger HW events. A robust cooling of the waters close to the Australian coast also contributes to the maintenance of the blocking highs locally, which is a fundamental ingredient to sustain the HWs.},

	abstract = {We use the 100-member Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) to disentangle the contributions from colocated dynamic atmospheric conditions and local thermodynamic effects of moisture limitation as drivers of variability in European summer heat extremes. Using a novel extreme event definition, we find that heat extremes with respect to the evolving mean climate increase by 70\% under a moderate warming scenario during the twenty-first century. With a multiple regression approach, we find that the dynamical mechanisms representing blocking and anticyclonic conditions are the main driver of variability in extreme European summer temperatures, both in past and future climates. By contrast, local thermodynamic drivers play a secondary role in explaining the total variability in extreme temperatures. We also find that considering both dynamical and thermodynamical sources of variability simultaneously is crucial. Assessing only one type of drivers leads to an overestimation of their effect on extreme temperatures, particularly when considering only thermodynamical drivers. Lastly, we find that although most past and future heat extremes occur under favorable dynamical atmospheric conditions; this occurs 10‚Äì40\% less frequently over Central Europe in the twenty-first century. By contrast, heat extremes over Central Europe occur 40\% more frequently under concurrent extreme moisture limitation in the twenty-first Century. Our findings highlight a new type of neutral-atmosphere, moisture-driven heat extremes, and confirm that the increase in European heat extremes and associated variability increase are dominated by the local thermodynamic effect of moisture limitation.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {During austral summer (DJF) 2017/18, the New Zealand region experienced an unprecedented coupled ocean-atmosphere heatwave, covering an area of 4 million km2. Regional average air temperature anomalies over land were +2.2 ¬∞C, and sea surface temperature anomalies reached +3.7 ¬∞C in the eastern Tasman Sea. This paper discusses the event, including atmospheric and oceanic drivers, the role of anthropogenic warming, and terrestrial and marine impacts. The heatwave was associated with very low wind speeds, reducing upper ocean mixing and allowing heat fluxes from the atmosphere to the ocean to cause substantial warming of the stratified surface layers of the Tasman Sea. The event persisted for the entire austral summer resulting in a 3.8 ¬± 0.6 km3 loss of glacier ice in the Southern Alps (the largest annual loss in records back to 1962), very early Sauvignon Blanc wine-grape maturation in Marlborough, and major species disruption in marine ecosystems. The dominant driver was positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) conditions, with a smaller contribution from La Ni√±a. The long-term trend towards positive SAM conditions, a result of stratospheric ozone depletion and greenhouse gas increase, is thought to have contributed through association with more frequent anticyclonic ‚Äòblocking‚Äô conditions in the New Zealand region and a more poleward average latitude for the Southern Ocean storm track. The unprecedented heatwave provides a good analogue for possible mean conditions in the late 21st century. The best match suggests this extreme summer may be typical of average New Zealand summer climate for 2081‚Äì2100, under the RCP4.5 or RCP6.0 scenario.},

However, great uncertainties still exist on the climate drivers of past and present glacier changes across scales. Here, we analyse continuous hourly climate station data from a glacierized elevation (Pyramid station, Mount Everest) since 1994 together with other ground observations and climate reanalysis. We show that a decrease in maximum air temperature and precipitation occurred during the last three decades at Pyramid in response to global warming. Reanalysis data suggest a broader occurrence of this effect in the glacierized areas of the Himalaya. We hypothesize that the counterintuitive cooling is caused by enhanced sensible heat exchange and the associated increase in glacier katabatic wind, which draws cool air downward from higher elevations. The stronger katabatic winds have also lowered the elevation of local wind convergence, thereby diminishing precipitation in glacial areas and negatively affecting glacier mass balance. This local cooling may have partially preserved glaciers from melting and could help protect the periglacial environment.},

After describing the summer climate of the AP using various dynamic and thermodynamic parameters, we investigate the link between extreme ISMs and atmospheric circulation over the AP on inter-annual time scale. Analysis of composites of different parameters during extreme monsoon (strong and weak) years reveals that the ISM plays an important role in the summer circulation over the AP and adjoining regions. The major noticeable changes in modulating circulation during extreme monsoons are: (1) a strengthening of lower tropospheric northerly winds, westerly winds passing through the Tokar Gap, Shamal winds, and the upper tropospheric easterly jet stream during strong ISM; (2) a northward (southward) shift of the subtropical westerly jet stream during strong (weak) monsoon years; (3) the development of strong upper level ridge above the surface thermal low during strong ISM years, which result in a baroclinic structure over the AP and adjoining regions; (4) an increase in adiabatic warming, and hence aridity, over the AP during strong monsoon years, caused by intense subsidence of the middle to upper troposphere due to zonal overturning circulation; and (5) convective instability during strong monsoon years caused by an intensification of the upward motion over the southern AP. Furthermore, during strong monsoons, the availability of excess moisture leads to atmospheric instability, which in turn triggers the formation of clouds that lead to more rainfall over the southwestern AP. Finally, the westward propagation of a Gill-type Rossby waves induced by the ISM play an important role in the variations of the AP summer climate by enhancing the warm core structure over the AP and through their interaction with the midlatitude westerlies during strong monsoons.},

	abstract = {Heat waves lead to major impacts on human health, food production, and ecosystems. To assess their predictability and how they are projected to change under global warming, it is crucial to improve our understanding of the underlying processes affecting their occurrence and intensity under present-day climate conditions. Beside greenhouse gas forcing, processes in the different components of the climate system‚Äîin particular the land surface, atmospheric circulation, and the oceans‚Äîmay play a key role in changing the odds for a particular event. This study aims to identify the role of the individual drivers for five heat waves (and, in some cases, of concurrent droughts) in the recent decade. Simulations are performed with the Community Earth System Model using nudging of horizontal atmospheric circulation and prescription of soil moisture. The fully constrained model accurately reproduces how anomalous an event was. Factorial experiments, which force the model toward observations for one or several key components at a time, allow us to identify how much of the observed temperature anomaly of each event can be attributed to each driver. Considering all analyzed events, atmospheric circulation and soil moisture play similarly important roles, each contributing between 20\% and 70\% to the events' anomalies. This highlights that the role of thermodynamics can be just as important as that of the dynamics for temperature extremes, a possibly underestimated feature. In addition, recent climate change amplified the events and contributed between 10\% and 40\% of the events' anomalies.},

	abstract = {Mega-heatwaves are among the deadliest natural disasters in midlatitudes. During such events, the atmospheric circulation is typically governed by persistent anticyclones, enabling cloud-free conditions and advection of hot air. Dry soils in heatwave regions are also known to further contribute to the escalation of air temperatures. However, while local land‚Äìatmosphere feedbacks are well studied, the same does not apply to the influence of upwind areas, from where heat is advected. Here we investigate reanalysis data using a Lagrangian heat-tracking model to unravel the role of upwind land‚Äìatmosphere feedbacks during the two European mega-heatwaves of this century: the events in 2003 and 2010. Our analysis indicates that advected sensible heat can come in torrents, suddenly and intensely, leading to abrupt increases in air temperatures that further strengthen local land‚Äìatmosphere feedbacks via soil desiccation. During both mega-heatwaves, about 30\% of the advected sensible heat was caused by the drought upwind. Since subtropical droughts are projected to aggravate during this century, in light of our results, this may be accompanied by consequent intensification of midlatitude mega-heatwaves. We therefore recommend considering not only local, but also upwind land cover and land-use management in the design of adaptation strategies against compound drought‚Äìheatwave events.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms leading to the occurrence of extreme weather and climate events are varied and complex. They generally encompass a combination of dynamic and thermodynamic processes, as well as drivers external to the climate system, such as anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and land use change. Here we present the ExtremeX multi-model intercomparison experiment, which was designed to investigate the contribution of dynamic and thermodynamic processes to recent weather and climate extremes. The numerical experiments are performed with three Earth system models: CESM, MIROC, and EC-Earth. They include control experiments with interactive atmosphere and land surface conditions, as well as experiments wherein the atmospheric circulation, soil moisture, or both are constrained using observation-based data. The temporal evolution and magnitude of temperature anomalies during heatwaves are well represented in the experiments with a constrained atmosphere. However, the magnitude of mean climatological biases in temperature and precipitation are not greatly reduced in any of the constrained experiments due to persistent or newly introduced biases. This highlights the importance of error compensations and tuning in the standard model versions. To show one possible application, ExtremeX is used to identify the main drivers of heatwaves and warm spells. The results reveal that both atmospheric circulation patterns and soil moisture conditions substantially contribute to the occurrence of these events. Soil moisture effects are particularly important in the tropics, the monsoon areas, and the Great Plains of the United States, whereas atmospheric circulation effects are major drivers in other midlatitude and high-latitude regions.},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

	abstract = {Unpacking and comprehending how black-box machine learning algorithms (such as deep learning models) make decisions has been a persistent challenge for researchers and end-users. Explaining time-series predictive models is useful for clinical applications with high stakes to understand the behavior of prediction models, e.g., to determine how different variables and time points influence the clinical outcome. However, existing approaches to explain such models are frequently unique to architectures and data where the features do not have a time-varying component. In this paper, we introduce WindowSHAP, a model-agnostic framework for explaining time-series classifiers using Shapley values. We intend for WindowSHAP to mitigate the computational complexity of calculating Shapley values for long time-series data as well as improve the quality of explanations. WindowSHAP is based on partitioning a sequence into time windows. Under this framework, we present three distinct algorithms of Stationary, Sliding and Dynamic WindowSHAP, each evaluated against baseline approaches, KernelSHAP and TimeSHAP, using perturbation and sequence analyses metrics. We applied our framework to clinical time-series data from both a specialized clinical domain (Traumatic Brain Injury - TBI) as well as a broad clinical domain (critical care medicine). The experimental results demonstrate that, based on the two quantitative metrics, our framework is superior at explaining clinical time-series classifiers, while also reducing the complexity of computations. We show that for time-series data with 120 time steps (hours), merging 10 adjacent time points can reduce the CPU time of WindowSHAP by 80 \% compared to KernelSHAP. We also show that our Dynamic WindowSHAP algorithm focuses more on the most important time steps and provides more understandable explanations. As a result, WindowSHAP not only accelerates the calculation of Shapley values for time-series data, but also delivers more understandable explanations with higher quality.},

	abstract = {Between 15 and 19 March 2022, East Antarctica experienced an exceptional heat wave with widespread 30‚Äì40C temperature anomalies across the ice sheet. In Part I, we assessed the meteorological drivers that generated an intense atmospheric river (AR) that caused these record-shattering temperature anomalies. Here, we continue our large collaborative study by analyzing the widespread and diverse impacts driven by the AR landfall. These impacts included widespread rain and surface melt that was recorded along coastal areas, but this was outweighed by widespread high snowfall accumulations resulting in a largely positive surface mass balance contribution to the East Antarctic region. An analysis of the surface energy budget indicated that widespread downward longwave radiation anomalies caused by large cloud-liquid water contents along with some scattered solar radiation produced intense surface warming. Isotope measurements of the moisture were highly elevated, likely imprinting a strong signal for past climate reconstructions. The AR event attenuated cosmic ray measurements at Concordia, something previously never observed. Last, an extratropical cyclone west of the AR landfall likely triggered the final collapse of the critically unstable Conger Ice Shelf while further reducing an already record low sea ice extent. Significance Statement Using our diverse collective expertise, we explored the impacts from the March 2022 heat wave and atmospheric river across East Antarctica. One key takeaway is that the Antarctic cryosphere is highly sensitive to meteorological extremes originating from the midlatitudes and subtropics. Despite the large positive temperature anomalies driven from strong downward longwave radiation, this event led to huge amounts of snowfall across the Antarctic interior desert. The isotopes in this snow of warm airmass origin will likely be detectable in future ice cores and potentially distort past climate reconstructions. Even measurements of space activity were affected. Also, the swells generated from this storm helped to trigger the final collapse of an already critically unstable Conger Ice Shelf while further degrading sea ice coverage.},

RNNs have been widely used in time-series data analysis, and various RNN algorithms have been proposed, such as the standard RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent units (GRUs). In particular, it has been experimentally proven that LSTM and GRU have higher validation accuracy and prediction accuracy than the standard RNN. The learning ability is a measure of the effectiveness of gradient of error information that would be backpropagated. This study provided a theoretical and experimental basis for the result that LSTM and GRU have more efficient gradient descent than the standard RNN by analyzing and experimenting the gradient vanishing of the standard RNN, LSTM, and GRU. As a result, LSTM and GRU are robust to the degradation of gradient descent even when LSTM and GRU learn long-range input data, which means that the learning ability of LSTM and GRU is greater than standard RNN when learning long-range input data. Therefore, LSTM and GRU have higher validation accuracy and prediction accuracy than the standard RNN. In addition, it was verified whether the experimental results of river-level prediction models, solar power generation prediction models, and speech signal models using the standard RNN, LSTM, and GRUs are consistent with the analysis results of gradient vanishing.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric models with typical resolution in the tenths of kilometers cannot resolve the dynamics of air parcel ascent, which varies on scales ranging from tens to hundreds of meters. Small-scale wind fluctuations are thus characterized by a subgrid distribution of vertical wind velocity W with standard deviation œÉ W . The parameterization of œÉ W is fundamental to the representation of aerosol‚Äìcloud interactions, yet it is poorly constrained. Using a novel deep learning technique, this work develops a new parameterization for œÉ W merging data from global storm-resolving model simulations, high-frequency retrievals of W , and climate reanalysis products. The parameterization reproduces the observed statistics of œÉ W and leverages learned physical relations from the model simulations to guide extrapolation beyond the observed domain. Incorporating observational data during the training phase was found to be critical for its performance. The parameterization can be applied online within large-scale atmospheric models, or offline using output from weather forecasting and reanalysis products.

Significance Statement
Vertical air motion plays a crucial role in several atmospheric processes, such as cloud droplet and ice crystal formation. However, it often occurs at scales smaller than those resolved by standard atmospheric models, leading to uncertainties in climate predictions. To address this, we present a novel deep learning approach that synthesizes data from various sources, providing a representation of small-scale vertical wind velocity suitable for integration into atmospheric models. Our method demonstrates high accuracy when compared to observation-based retrievals, offering potential to mitigate uncertainties and enhance climate forecasting.},

	abstract = {Understanding how different physical processes can shape the probability distribution function (PDF) of surface temperature, in particular the tails of the distribution, is essential for the attribution and projection of future extreme temperature events. In this study, the contribution of soil moisture-atmosphere interactions to surface temperature PDFs is investigated. Soil moisture represents a key variable in the coupling of the land and atmosphere, since it controls the partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat flux at the surface. Consequently, soil moisture variability driven by the atmosphere may feed back onto the near-surface climate-in particular, temperature. In this study, two simulations of the current-generation Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Earth System Model, with and without interactive soil moisture, are analyzed in order to assess how soil moisture dynamics impact the simulated climate. Comparison of these simulations shows that soil moisture dynamics enhance both temperature mean and variance over regional "hotspots" of land atmosphere coupling. Moreover, higher-order distribution moments, such as skewness and kurtosis, are also significantly impacted, suggesting an asymmetric impact on the positive and negative extremes of the temperature PDF. Such changes are interpreted in the context of altered distributions of the surface turbulent and radiative fluxes. That the moments of the temperature distribution may respond differentially to soil moisture dynamics underscores the importance of analyzing moments beyond the mean and variance to characterize fully the interplay of soil moisture and near-surface temperature. In addition, it is shown that soil moisture dynamics impacts daily temperature variability at different time scales over different regions in the model.},

Climate change and deforestation are two significant drivers of such trends. In the Amazon rainforest, heat waves are still an understudied issue, in part due to limited surface observations. To date, heat waves in central Amazon have been associated with the ITCZ northward migration in austral winter, weakening moisture influx through the South American Monsoon System. This study contributes to this topic by being the first Amazon-specific analysis of heat extremes and the first in South America to jointly explore extreme heat wave events and associated synoptic atmospheric and land surface conditions. Ten of the most extreme heat waves are identified in the Southeast of Amazonia, from Era-Interim (1979 to 2018) maximum daily temperature records. Dry conditions are measured from relative humidity and evaporative fraction anomalies at surface and vertically also using the Era-Interim data. In all 10 events an extreme drying signal co-occurs with extreme heat waves. Wind patterns and anomalies revealed a consistent easterly dry advection anomalously extending to Southeast Amazonia. In addition, an intensification of the northerly South Atlantic Anticyclone wind circulation reduced the influx of moisture to Southeast Amazon, namely linked to the South American Low Level Jet. These, together, contributed to a compound effect on the extreme heat waves under near-surface drying conditions, which escalated hot temperatures to extreme heat.},

However, the majority of research conducted on this topic is focused on high income areas of the world. Although heat waves have the most severe impacts on vulnerable populations, relatively few studies have studied their impacts in low and middle income countries (LMICs). The aim of this paper is to review the existing evidence in the literature on the impact of heat on human health in LMICs. We identified peer-reviewed epidemiologic studies published in English between January 1980 and August 2018 investigating potential associations between high ambient temperature or heat waves and mortality or morbidity. We selected studies according to the following criteria: quantitative studies that used primary and/or secondary data and report effect estimates where ambient temperature or heat waves are the main exposure of interest in relation to human morbidity or mortality within LMICs. Of the total 146 studies selected, eighty-two were conducted in China, nine in other countries of East Asia and the Pacific, twelve in South Asia, ten in Sub-Saharan Africa, eight in the Middle East and North Africa, and seven in each of Latin America and Europe. The majority of studies (92.9\%) found positive associations between heat and human morbidity/mortality. Additionally, while outcome variables and study design differed greatly, most utilized a time-series study design and examined overall heath related morbidity/mortality impacts in an entire population, although it is notable that the selected studies generally found that the elderly, women, and individuals within the low socioeconomic brackets were the most vulnerable to the effects of high temperature. By highlighting the existing evidence on the impact of extreme heat on health in LMICs, we hope to determine data needs and help direct future studies in addressing this knowledge gap. The focus on LMICs is justified by the lack of studies and data studying the health burden of higher temperatures in these regions even though LMICs have a lower capacity to adapt to high temperatures and thus an increased risk.},

In the Tasman Sea (TS), several relatively intense and broad-scale MHWs have caused significant damage to marine fisheries and aquaculture industries. To assess the potential predictability of these events, we first determined the main driver of each MHW event in the TS from 1993 to 2021. We found that those MHWs driven by ocean advection-approximately 45\% of all events-are generally longer in duration and less intense and affected a smaller area compared with the remaining 55\%, which are driven by air-sea heat fluxes, are shorter in duration, and are more surface intense. As ocean advection-driven events in the TS have been closely studied and reported previously, we focus here on atmospherically driven MHWs. The predictability of these events is assessed by identifying the patterns of atmospheric pressure, winds, and air-sea heat fluxes in the Southern Hemisphere that coincide with MHWs in the Tasman Sea. We found that atmospherically driven MHWs in this region are more likely to occur during the positive phase of the asymmetric Southern Annular Mode (A-SAM)-which presents as an atmospheric zonal wave-3 pattern and is more likely to occur during La Ni√±a years. These A-SAM events are linked to low wind speeds and increased downward solar radiation in the TS, which lead to increased surface ocean temperatures through the reduction of mixing.},

	abstract = {Recent temperature extremes have highlighted the importance of assessing projected changes in the variability of temperature as well as the mean. A large fraction of present-day temperature variance is associated with thermal advection, as anomalous winds blow across the land-sea temperature contrast, for instance. Models project robust heterogeneity in the twenty-first-century warming pattern under greenhouse gas forcing, resulting in land-sea temperature contrasts increasing in summer and decreasing in winter and the pole-to-equator temperature gradient weakening in winter. In this study, future changes in monthly variability of near-surface temperature in the 17-member ensemble ESSENCE (Ensemble Simulations of Extreme Weather Events under Nonlinear Climate Change) are assessed. In winter, variability in midlatitudes decreases whereas in very high latitudes and the tropics it increases. In summer, variability increases over most land areas and in the tropics, with decreasing variability in high latitude oceans. Multiple regression analysis is used to determine the contributions to variability changes from changing temperature gradients and circulation patterns. Thermal advection is found to be of particular importance in the Northern Hemisphere winter midlatitudes, where the change in mean state temperature gradients alone could account for over half the projected changes. Changes in thermal advection are also found to be important in summer in Europe and coastal areas, although less so than in winter. Comparison with CMIP5 data shows that the midlatitude changes in variability are robust across large regions, particularly high northern latitudes in winter and middle northern latitudes in summer.},

	abstract = {Eastern China experienced persistent regional extreme heatwaves in the summer of 2022, with disparate spatial features and formation mechanisms in different months. We quantitatively assessed the relative contributions of three oceans, i.e. tropical Indian Ocean and Pacific and North Atlantic, and the local soil moisture‚Äìtemperature feedback using linear regression. The results showed that the monthly mean atmospheric circulation anomalies failed to explain the extreme heatwave in June 2022. The combined contribution of the tropical Indo-Pacific and North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs), together with the local soil moisture‚Äìtemperature feedback, explaining approximately 10\% of the temperature anomalies. In July, the tropical Indo-Pacific SSTAs promoted anomalous atmospheric circulation and extreme heat via meridional circulation originating in the Maritime Continent, accounting for approximately 10\% of the temperature anomalies, with North Atlantic SSTAs contributing the same percentage by a mid-latitude steady Rossby wave. Local soil moisture‚Äìtemperature feedback accounted for 42\% of the anomalies. The tropical Indo-Pacific SSTAs produced a strong western North Pacific anticyclone in August, but their direct contribution to the temperature anomalies was negligible. The North Atlantic SSTAs contributed 9\% of the total via the mid-latitude steady Rossby wave. Local soil moisture‚Äìtemperature feedback contributed 66\%, suggesting that the July heatwave and drought exerted a significant impact on the subsequent August extreme heatwave. Global warming has greatly facilitated extreme heatwaves, accounting for about 30\%‚Äì40\% of these events in summer 2022. These results also suggest that the climatic effects of tropical Indo-Pacific and North Atlantic SSTAs on Eastern China are evident in the month-to-month variation in summer. Our results thus contribute to the understanding and prediction of extreme heatwaves in Eastern China.},

For such feedbacks to occur, the coupled land‚Äìatmosphere system must exhibit sufficient memory of soil moisture anomalies associated with the extreme event. The soil moisture autocorrelation e-folding time scale has been used previously to estimate soil moisture memory. However, the theoretical basis for this metric (i.e., that the land water budget is reasonably approximated by a red noise process) does not apply at finer spatial and temporal resolutions relevant to modern satellite observations and models. In this study, two memory time scale metrics are introduced that are relevant to modern satellite observations and models: the ‚Äúlong-term memory‚Äù [Formula: see text] and the ‚Äúshort-term memory‚Äù [Formula: see text]. Short- and long-term surface soil moisture (SSM) memory time scales are spatially anticorrelated at global scales in both a model and satellite observations, suggesting hot spots of land‚Äìatmosphere coupling will be located in different regions, depending on the time scale of the feedback. Furthermore, the spatial anticorrelation between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] demonstrates the importance of characterizing these memory time scales separately, rather than mixing them as in previous studies.},

	abstract = {Arctic warm extremes and anomalous sea ice melting have been linked to episodic injections of warm and moist air from mid-latitudes, as well as airmass transformations inside the Arctic. However, the relative importance of remote and local processes for such events remains unclear. Here, we focus on events with extreme positive daily-mean surface energy budget (SEB) anomalies over Arctic sea ice in ERA5 reanalysis data during extended winters (Nov - Mar, 1979 ‚Äì 2020). Kinematic backward trajectories from the tropospheric column collocated with the SEB anomalies show that near-surface air is of Arctic origin, whereas air further aloft is transported poleward from mid-latitudes and ascends. Despite the different origin of the air, the entire tropospheric column shows pronounced potential temperature anomalies (order of 10 K) building up along air-parcel trajectories over 2-4 days. Quantifying the contributions of horizontal and vertical transport as well as diabatic processes to the generation of these potential temperature anomalies emphasizes the relevance of horizontal advection across the climatological potential temperature gradient for the generation of the anomalies at all levels. Anomalies aloft are further enhanced by latent heating and those near the surface by subsidence, respectively. Surface heat fluxes over subpolar and polar oceans are key for warming and moistening the near-surface air of predominantly Arctic origin and maintaining a positive potential temperature anomaly, which due to its proximity to the surface unfolds the strongest impact on the SEB. This suggests that Arctic airmasses and their local transformations are crucial for generating the most extreme SEB anomalies.},

	issn = {0894-8763},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/26184479},
	abstract = {ABSTRACT Heat waves are a major cause of weather-related deaths. With the current concern for global warming it is reasonable to suppose that they may increase in frequency, severity, duration, or areal extent in the future. However, in the absence of an adequate definition of a heat wave, it is impossible to assess either changes in the past or possible consequences for the future. A set of definitions is proposed here, based on the criteria for heat stress forecasts developed by the National Weather Service (NWS). Watches or warnings are issued when thresholds of daytime high and nighttime low heat index (Hi) values are exceeded for at least two consecutive days. The heat index is a combination of ambient temperature and humidity that approximates the environmental aspect of the thermal regime of a human body, with the NWS thresholds representing a generalized estimate of the onset of physiological stress. These thresholds cannot be applied directly nationwide. In hot and humid regions, physical, social, and cultural adaptations will require that the thresholds be set higher to ensure that only those events perceived as stressful are identified. In other, cooler, areas the NWS criteria may never be reached even though unusually hot events may be perceived as heat waves. Thus, it is likely that a similar number of perceived heat events will occur in all regions, with the thresholds varying regionally. Hourly Hi for 178 stations in the coterminous United States was analyzed for the 1951‚Äì90 period to determine appropriate threshold criteria. Use of the NWS criteria alone indicated that much of the nation had less than three heat waves per decade, and this value was adopted as the baseline against which to establish suitable thresholds. For all areas, a percentile threshold approach was tested. Using all available data, daytime high and nighttime low thresholds were established separately for each specific percentile. Heat waves were treated as occurring when conditions exceeded both the daytime high and the nighttime low thresholds of the same percentile for two consecutive days. Several thresholds were tested. For much of the South, 1\% thresholds produced appropriate values. Consequently, a heat wave was defined as a period of at least 48 h during which neither the overnight low nor the daytime high Hi falls below the NWS heat stress thresholds (80¬∞ and 105¬∞F, respectively), except at stations for which more than 1\% of both the annual high and low Hi observations exceed these thresholds, in which case the 1\% values are used as the heat wave thresholds. As an extension, ‚Äúhot spells‚Äù were similarly defined, but for events falling between the 1\% values and NWS thresholds, with ‚Äúwarm spells‚Äù occurring between the 2\% and 1\% values. Again, stations for which the 1\% or 2\% Hi values exceed the NWS thresholds were given modified definitions. The preliminary investigation of the timing and location of heat waves resulting from these definitions indicated that they correctly identified major epidemiological events. A tentative climatic comparison also suggests that heat waves are becoming less frequent in the southern and more frequent in the midwestern and eastern parts of the nation.},

	abstract = {Understanding and quantifying the relationships between evaporation of water in one region, precipitation in another, and the transport processes connecting them, is one of the key problems in hydrometeorology. However, to date few methods exist that are suitable for establishing these relationships. In this paper, a new Lagrangian technique is described that builds on methods that have been developed for investigating source-receptor re- lationships for air pollutants. It is based on meteorological analysis data and a particle dispersion model and uses a Lagrangian analog to the Eulerian budget method to diagnose the surface moisture flux. Because of its Lagrangian nature, regions of net evaporation are connected by trajectories with regions of net precipitation, and these trajectories can be used to examine how the two are related. The method is shown to yield estimates for the global distribution of the annual mean surface freshwater flux that are equally accurate as those obtained with the Eulerian budget method. It is then applied in a case study of an extreme precipitation event that occurred in central Europe in August 2002 and led to floodings with return periods of 100 to 300 yr in some river catchments. Again it is shown that the moisture fluxes obtained with the Lagrangian and Eulerian method, respectively, agree well with each other, and both agree well with observed precipitation patterns and short- range precipitation forecasts. Then the new method is used to determine where the water that became precipitation during the flooding event has evaporated. It is found that in addition to a strong Mediterranean source, much of the water evaporated from land. The strong extra evaporation over land was likely due to a wet spell the weeks before that left soils saturated with water in large parts of Europe and flooded in some smaller regions. It appears that precipitation forecasts suffered from predicting too little evaporation in these regions.},

In this paper, we focus on the need for flood forecasting and propose an interpretable Spatio-Temporal Attention Long Short Term Memory model (STA-LSTM) based on LSTM and attention mechanism. We use dynamic attention mechanism and LSTM to build model, Max-Min method to normalize data, variable control method to select hyperparameters, and Adam algorithm to train the model. Emphasis is placed on the visualization and interpretation of attention weights. Experiment results on three small and medium basins in China suggest that the proposed STA-LSTM model outperforms Historical Average (HA), Fully Connected Network (FCN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), original LSTM (LSTM), spatial attention LSTM (SA-LSTM), and temporal attention LSTM (TA-LSTM) in most cases. Visualization and interpretation of spatial and temporal attention weights reflect the reasonability of the proposed attention-based model.},

Oceanic tropical instability waves (TIWs) with periods of 20‚Äì40 days and wavelengths of 1000‚Äì2000 km perturb the SST fronts that bracket both sides of the equatorial cold tongue, which is centered near 1¬∞S to the east of 130¬∞W. These perturbations are characterized by cusp-shaped features that propagate systematically westward on both sides of the equator. The space‚Äìtime structures of these SST perturbations are reproduced with remarkable detail in the surface wind stress field. The wind stress divergence is shown to be linearly related to the downwind component of the SST gradient with a response on the south side of the cold tongue that is about twice that on the north side. The wind stress curl is linearly related to the crosswind component of the SST gradient with a response that is approximately half that of the wind stress divergence response to the downwind SST gradient. The perturbed SST and wind stress fields propagate synchronously westward with the TIWs. This close coupling between SST and wind stress supports the Wallace et al. hypothesis that surface winds vary in response to SST modification of atmospheric boundary layer stability.},

This study demonstrates that dominant mode of subtropical SA sea surface temperature (SST) variability during the boreal winter, referred to as the South Atlantic Subtropical Dipole (SASD), contributes to occurrence of an El Ni√±o a year later. During a positive SASD, low-tropospheric anticyclonic circulation anomalies over the mid-latitude SA reduce convective activities over southeastern South America. The low-tropospheric divergence anomalies associated with the reduced convection attenuate the occurrence of South American Low-Level Jet, and moisture supply is directed along the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). The increased precipitation over the SACZ leads to an anomalous surface easterly that lowers the SST over the equatorial Atlantic and eventually modulates the zonal Walker circulation, thereby favoring El Ni√±o development.},
