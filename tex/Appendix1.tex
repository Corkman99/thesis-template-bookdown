\section{Further examples of trajectory data}

Find below the trajectory timeseries visualisation plots - as figure 3.2 - for the locations in figure 3.1. Each figure contains plots (a-d) of TX1day Tâ€™ decompositions for years 1980 to 2020. The x-axis is logarithmic to better represent the recent history. The trajectory yielding the largest final $T'$ among all years is colored red, the time-mean of all trajectories in black and the inter-quantile range is highlighted in light blue. Plot (e) shows the (auto-)correlation between the final $T'$ and the $T'$ at different lags for the event and each contributor. Plot (f) shows the (cross-)correlation between the final event $T'$ and the $T'$ at different lags for each contributor. They are computed for all samples that have genesis time earlier than the considered time-lag.
