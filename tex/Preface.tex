\chapter*{Preface}

First words and acknowledgements

This thesis has been a unique opportunity to place myself at the head of a scientific project. I wanted to development my own project and contribute to my field of interest. It was foremost a humbling experience, as the challenges of interdisplinary research taught me many lessons. I would like to extend my gratitude to Matthias, Maybritt, Belinda, Heini and Nicolai for the support and guidance you provided: I cherish the many lessons you have taught me.
