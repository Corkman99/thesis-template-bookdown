This thesis has been a unique opportunity to place myself at the head of a scientific project, and it was foremost a humbling experience, as the challenges of interdisplinary research taught me many lessons. Throughout all the ups and down, I would like to thank my friends for the moments of comfort, for being great rubber duck, and for all the laughs and good times. I will miss you all a lot and am eager to follow all your future adventures. Grazie mamma per essere stata sempre raggiungibile, per le peosie ispirante e le foto del grigio che mi fanno soridere molto. Merci papa pour ces parties de ping-pong qui me sont si importantes et les bons verres de vins. To Matt and Luca, always wonderful to have you around: I cherish all the moments we have together. 

To my Manu,
