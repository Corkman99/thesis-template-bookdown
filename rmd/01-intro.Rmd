# Introduction

The R package `bookdownplus` [@Reference] , [@HamF85], @StaWW91 [p. 15] is an
extension of `bookdown`. Indeed, you can also just dispay the year from 
the reference: I.e. Stahel was right [-@StaWW91]. You can find all supported
citation formats [here](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations). Here are 
some: 

* [@StaWW91]
* [see @StaWW91 p.3]
* Chollet [-@StaWW91, p.3] says
* @StaWW91 [p. 3]


It is a collection of multiple templates on the basis
of LaTeX, which are tailored so that I can work happily under the umbrella of
`bookdown`. `bookdownplus` helps you write academic journal articles, guitar
books, chemical equations, mails, calendars, and diaries.
