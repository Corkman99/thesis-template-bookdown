# Introduction

## Motivation 

In recent years, heat-related near-surface extreme events have globally become increasingly important. These include hot extremes and heatwaves, that we characterized by short, sudden spikes in temperatures and periods of prolonged positive temperature anomalies, respectively. Hot extremes in particular have been shown to impact human health through high mortality and morbidity rates in certain demographics (Medina-Ram√≥n et al., 2007; Astrom et al., 2011; Green et al., 2019; Ebi et al., 2021); can be damaging to agricultural and ecological systems through productivity decreases and heat stress (Teixeira et al., 2013; Gourdji et al., 2013;  Vogel et al., 2019); and may pressure national economies by increasing energy demands (Perera et al., 2020) compounded with damage to thermal-power plant infrastructure (Entricken and Lordan, 2012), as well as lowering labor productivity (Garcia-Leon et al., 2021). Furthermore, climate change is expected to exacerbate hot extreme impacts through an increase in the frequency of their occurence as well as their intensity (R. Slater et al., 2021; E. Fischer et al. 2021; V. Thompson et al., 2022). Indeed, extreme value analysis by Liu et al. (2021) finds that 50-year hot extreme events will be 7 times more likely in the period 2071 - 2100 averaged over all land areas, with a 5.3&deg;C increase in magnitude. There is thus a need for robust process understanding of the drivers of hot extremes to improve forecasting capabilities for emergency warning systems and assist in the planning of future adaptation and mitigation strategies. 

Coupled with increasing mean global temperatures, recent record-shattering events highlight the importance in understanding not only the evolution and drivers of typical hot extremes, but also their variability. The Pacific North-West 2021 event is particularly illustrative, breaking the national temperature record by more than 4&deg;C and leading to more than a thousand deaths (White et al., 2023). Hai Lin et al. (2022) demonstrate that no ensemble member resolved such intense temperature 10 days before the event while analysis by V. Lucarini et al. (2023) suggests this event may become typical when conditioning on the existence of large and persistent temperature anomalies locally. Uncovering the physical differences that separate such rare events from lower-intensity hot extremes will provide insights into improving forecasting, in addition to furthering understanding of how they may evolve under climate change. 

Add that studies have shown changes in the distribution of hot extreme both as shifts and as variance changes. Thus an understanding of influences on variability is required.
