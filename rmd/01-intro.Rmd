# Introduction

## Motivation 

In recent years, heat-related near-surface extreme events have globally become increasingly important. These include hot extremes and heatwaves, that we characterized by short, sudden spikes in temperatures and periods of prolonged positive temperature anomalies, respectively. Hot extremes in particular have been shown to impact human health through high mortality and morbidity rates in certain demographics \citep{medina-ramon_temperature_2007,oudin_astrom_heat_2011,green_impact_2019,ebi_hot_2021}; can be damaging to agricultural and ecological systems through productivity decreases and heat stress \citep{teixeira_global_2013,gourdji_global_2013,vogel_effects_2019}; and may pressure national economies by increasing energy demands \citep{perera_quantifying_2020} compounded with damage to thermal-power plant infrastructure \citep{entriken_impacts_2012}, as well as lowering labor productivity \citep{garcia-leon_current_2021}. Furthermore, climate change is expected to exacerbate hot extreme impacts through an increase in the frequency of their occurrence as well as their intensity \citep{slater_substantial_2021,fischer_increasing_2021,thompson_2021_2022}. Uncovering the associations between hot extreme event magnitudes and the processes developing such events is therefore crucial for more robust understanding of future changes in extremes and improving forecasting capabilities for emergency warning systems and assist in the planning of future adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Coupled with increasing mean global temperatures, recent record-shattering events highlight the importance in understanding not only the evolution and drivers of typical hot extremes, but also their variability. The Pacific North-West 2021 event is particularly illustrative, breaking the national temperature record by more than 4&deg;C and leading to more than a thousand deaths \citep{white_unprecedented_2023}. \cite{lin_2021_2022} demonstrate that no ensemble member resolved such intense temperature 10 days before the event while analysis by \cite{lucarini_typicality_2023} suggests this event may become typical when conditioning on the existence of large and persistent temperature anomalies locally. Uncovering the physical differences that separate such rare events from lower-intensity hot extremes will provide insights into improving forecasting, in addition to furthering understanding of how they may evolve under climate change. 

## Outline

This thesis will attempt to bridge these knowledge gaps. Chapter 2 will give a comprehensive overview of hot extreme literature, review important meteorological background and introduce the work that this thesis extends. Chapter 3 will give a brief outline of statistical tools and methods. Chapter 4 will describe the data used for this analysis and provide some illustrative examples. Chapter 5 will motivate and propose the employed methodologies and Chapter 6 will present and discuss the obtained results. Chapter 7 offers a broader discussion on the findings of this thesis and Chapter 7 will summarize the work as well as suggest avenues for future research.
