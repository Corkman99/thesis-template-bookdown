# Meteorological Background

It is important to recognize that the literature on heat extremes presents diverse and at times contradictory definitions of hot events. In this report, a 'hot extreme event' will describe an anomalously high spike in near-surface temperature occurring over the timescale of a day. A 'heatwave' will then describe an event of prolonged anomalously high near-surface temperature on the order of multiple days or weeks. In addition to reviewing literature on hot extremes, this section discusses heatwave research as they, although being distinct, often evolve together (Robinson, 2001).

## Mechanisms of hot extreme development

The temperature of a volume air - generally referred to as an air parcel in atmospheric sciences - can increase due to three primary mechanisms: warm **advection** involves the horizontal transport of warmer air parcels into a climatologically colder region; **adiabatic heating** is the result of descending air that compresses and thus heats; **diabatic heating** involves radiative effects including sensible heat fluxes from the Earth's surface. The absence of these three mechanisms (cold air advection, ascending air and diabatic cooling) can also contribute to the formation of hot extremes. This characterisation provides a uniform basis to discuss atmospheric phenomena linked to hot extreme evolution and suggests a methodology, later discussed, to quantify the contribution of these physical processes to specific events. .

In the mid-latitudes, anticyclonic flow situations serve as the basis for hot extreme development (e.g. Pfahl and Wernli, 2012). They are often associated with atmospheric blocks - a pattern characterized by persistent anticyclonic activity that prevents the influence of the prevailing flows [@lupo_atmospheric_2021] - or amplified and quasi-stationary ridges (Sousa et al., 2018). Thereby, they develop regions of large subsidence and clear skies conducive to strong radiative heating in summer [@lupo_atmospheric_2021]. Indeed, atmospheric blocks co-locates with hot extremes, particularly well over the Northern (Pfahl and Wernli, 2012; Bieli et al., 2014; Brunner et al., 2018) and Southern (Pezza et al., 2011) mid-latitudes, although with significant spatial variability and large land-ocean contrasts. Over Europe, Stefano et al. (2012) suggests that increased sensible heat fluxes from higher soil moisture content and/or hydrological pre-conditioning are partly responsible for the observed land patterns, while the land-ocean contrast may be explained by a lower temperature variability due to water's larger heat capacity. 

In the polar latitudes, a diversity of atypical mechanisms may evolve due to the presence of snow and ice-sheets. Generally, an enhanced albedo effect implies lower diabatic heating and the temperature inversion created by a cold surface temperature limits adiabatic heating. Furthermore, ice-sheets are found at relatively high altitudes (Fretwell et al., 2013) leading to adiabatic cooling from ascending air parcels **ask Belinda again here**. Some studies have also suggested that intrusions of sub-polar air into the Arctic, such as by atmospheric rivers (AR) - corridors of rapidly ascending sub-tropical air that transport moisture and heat north/south-wards - may disturb the polar climate (Ma et al., 2017, Papritz et al., 2023). This may lead to increasing downward longwave radiation that accelerates sea-ice melting (Kapsch et al., 2013 Mortin et al., 2016) and advective warming at both lower and upper levels (Papritz et al., 2023). Indeed, a case-study on the March 2022 East Antarctica heat extreme shows that intense atmospheric blocking initiated by an AR led to the weakening of the ice-sheet temperature inversion, intensifying adiabatic heating from subsiding air (Wille et al., 2022). 

In the tropics, the weather is predominantly influenced by circulation anomalies (such as the El-Nino Southern Oscillation) and local moist convective systems (although anti-cyclonic activity may still be a major synoptic driver). The limited literature on tropical hot extremes and heatwaves find a strong association of hot extreme events with dry land conditions, indicative of strong coupling between land-surface processes and the atmosphere: anti-cyclonic activity yielding clear skies may enhance radiative heating and reduce soil-moisture (Geirinhas et al., 2018; Costa et al., 2022), in turn decreasing the potential of latent cooling - the loss of heat due to evaporation - and increasing sensible heat fluxes. Theoretical work by Byrne (2021) suggests that the onset of moist convection increases relative humidity which limits the growth of positive temperature anomalies. 

Soil moisture and its complex dependence with near-surface temperature is not only important in the tropics, but also in the extra-tropics. Low soil-moisture content is associated with increased sensible and decreased latent heating, which can reduce the potential for precipitation from deep convection and/or support a blocking high-pressure system, thus enhancing dry conditions (Berg et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2019). In the context of climate change, Vogel et al. (2017) quantified the contribution of these soil moisture-temperature feedbacks to regional increase in TX1day magnitude at more than 70\% in Central Europe and Central North America, and around 50\% in Amazonia, Northern Australia and Southern Africa. These mechanisms may evolve differently on small or relatively large temporal and spatial scales (McColl et al., 2019), further illustrating their complexity. A systematic and global analysis of their contribution to yearly hot extremes still lacks. 

Hot extreme events over oceans have received little attention in the literature, likely due to their smaller impact on society. The absence of land-surface processes in the extra-tropics is expected to lead to a stronger influence of the large scale dynamics on hot extreme development, with adiabatic heating in the subsidence regions of the Hadley cell and advective warming in the mid-latitudes. Furthermore, I expect that regions with cooler sea surface temperatures (SSTs) than air temperature experience diabatic cooling, while in the tropics and over warm poleward currents, the opposite situation might be important with a warmer ocean surface inducing positive diabatic contributions. These processes may also involve coupling with marine heatwave, although this goes beyond the scope of this research. 

Rothlisberger and Papritz (2023) present a global quantification of the mean-contribution of physical processes to hot extreme events. This analysis mostly agrees with the aforementioned literature, with exceptions over mountainous regions and isolated continental regions. It therefore provides a valuable summary, presented in Figure \@ref(fig:dominantmean). Further description of their work is included in [Temperature anomaly decomposition].

## Variability of hot extreme events

So far, we have focused on the understanding of diverse mechanisms that yield hot extreme events across the globe. Several studies have however focused on relating the variability of these processes to the resulting hot extremes variability. In the European mid-latitudes, changes in variability have been attributed to an increase in anticyclonic activity and advective heating (Lenderink et al., 2007; Horton et al., 2015; Holmes et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2023) and to the local effects of soil-moisture (Quesada et al., 2012; Whan et al., 2015; Donat et al., 2017; Vogel et al., 2017). More generally, L. Suarez-Gutierrez et al. (2020) suggests investigating variability changes with regard to dynamical and thermodynamical sources, and concludes that the former - encompassing effects of atmospheric blocking - is the main driver of hot extreme variability. 

The distribution of regional-to-global hot extremes is expected to both shift positively in the mean (e.g. Lewis and King, 2017 - others if we need Brown et al., 2008; McKinnon et al., 2017) and increase in variability due to climate change. E. Fischer and C. Schar (2008) quantified the projected changes in hot extreme variability over Europe with respect to the processes associated with inter-annual variability, intra-seasonal variability and the seasonal variability in summer months, finding the largest contribution from the former. Di Luca et al. (2020) quantified the contributions of annual and diurnal first and second-moment features to daily hot extremes over land, showing a diversity of global patterns. However, these approaches lack a direct interpretation since the temporal features may be associated with different physical processes in different regions. 

## Methods in hot extreme literature

The weather extremes literature uses two main methodologies: sensitivity and trajectory analysis. To motivate the following work, we give a brief overview of these approaches, and include Figure X to illustrate their differences.

**Sensitivity analysis** (SA) is the most widely adopted approach to study the effects of initial conditions and model parameters on outputs of a system. It involves running different experiments with simulation tools (including numerical and data-driven models) and assessing the changes in distribution of the response. Formally, sensitivity is defined as the partial derivative of the response with regard to a predictor of interest. It is then related to causality: if one assumes a linear structural model, sensitivity is a measure of the causal effect of a variable on the response. SA literature has considered both local and global measures of sensitivity. The former involves evaluating the sensitivity at a given predictor value and therefore cannot conclude general causal relationships without strong assumptions. The latter presents a difficult problem and different approaches have been proposed that include many typical statistical estimators (Razavi and Gupta, 2015).

**Trajectory analysis** (TA) follows the changes to air parcels along their flow within a dynamical system. This approach takes a Lagrangian perspective, as opposed to the Eulerian perspective that trackes changes to a volume of air at a fixed spatial coordinate. In the context of extreme weather, TA often involves the identification of an event within a numerical model followed by calculation of the flow backwards in time. The output is a timeseries of physical and model quantities that describe the state history of the parcel which gave rise to the extreme event. These characteristics have been used both to understand single events in case-studies (e.g. Stohl and James, 2004; Huang and Cui, 2015; Papritz and Rothlisberger, 2023) as well as to gain a general understanding of drivers of extreme weather by aggregation of multiple events (e.g. Bieli et al., 2014; Quinting and Reeder, 2017; Rothlisberger and Papritz, 2023).

This thesis uses TA to focus on process understanding of hot extreme development and will expand existing literature, introduced below.

## Temperature anomaly decomposition

This investigation is based on a Lagrangian decomposition of temperature anomaly (Rothlisberger and Papritz, 2023), which quantifies the contributions of advective (adv), adiabatic (adiab) and diabatic (diab) processes in the generation of temperature anomaly ($T'$). TA based on T's, rather than temperature, leads to a more natural interpretation of the components' contributions, since some processes of interest, such as warming from horizontal advection, arize due to the presence of anomalously air within a dynamic environment. 

At location $\mathbf{x}$ and starting time of the backward trajectory $t_X$, $T'$ may be decomposed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{alignedat}{2}
   T'(\mathbf{x},t_X) = & - \int_{t_g}^{t_X} \frac{\partial \bar{T}}{\partial t} \, \text{d}\tau && \qquad \text{seas} \\
   & - \int_{t_g}^{t_X} \mathbf{\nu} \mathbf{\nabla}_h \bar{T} \, \text{d}\tau && \qquad \text{adv} \\
   & + \int_{t_g}^{t_X} \left[ \frac{\kappa T}{p} - \frac{\partial +  \bar{T}}{\partial p}\right] \omega \, \text{d}\tau && \qquad \text{adiab} \\
   & + \int_{t_g}^{t_X} \left( \frac{p}{p_0} \right)^\kappa \frac{\text{D}\theta}{\text{D}t} \, \text{d}\tau && \qquad \text{diab}
\end{alignedat}
(\#eq:tdecomp)
\end{equation}

where $\bar{T}$ the temperature climatology; $t_g < t_X$ genesis time, the time at which $T'$ was last zero; $\mathbf{\nu}$ the horizontal wind velocity; $\mathbf{\nabla}_h$ the horizontal temperature gradient; $p$ pressure; $\omega$ vertical velocity; $\theta$ potential temperature. 

To study hot extremes globally and systematically, Rothlisberger and Papritz (2023) applied \@ref(eq:tdecomp) to yearly maxima of 1-day temperature anomaly averages - denoted TX1day - at every grid point in ERA5 (further described in [Data]). Timeseries of backward trajectories - calculated with LAGRANTO (Sprenger and Wernli, 2015) - are numerically integrated to approximate the integrals. Since weather phenomenon might result from different flows, for yearly maxima event at each grid-point, a total of 24 backward trajectories corresponding to the 3 lower model-levels (**not model levels, but 10,30,50 hPa**) and the 8 daily 3-hour timesteps are integrated and then mean-aggregated. Each backward trajectory was back-computed until genesis $t=t_g$ up to a maximum of 120 time-steps (15 days). 

## Conclusion 

Although a good general understanding of mean-state hot extreme evolution exists and more detailed assessments have been made regionally and comparing specific high-impact events, a knowledge-gap in quantifying the contribution of known physical processes to hot extreme magnitude variability globally exists. This thesis attempts to close this gap by first proposing a systematic analysis of second-moment characteristics of hot extreme events and second applying state-of-the-art deep-learning methods to uncover patterns in trajectory features important for the development of hot extremes.
