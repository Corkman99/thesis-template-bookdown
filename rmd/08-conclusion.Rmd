# Conclusion

I expect that a successful timeseries model would be able to accomodate: a variety of different classes of multivariate behaviours which can be interpreted as general heat-generating flows; assess the influence of early-development characteristics of parcels in addition to the more important recent history; forecast all contributors 12-36 hours (4-12 timesteps) hours ahead; be able to assign importance to specific timesteps or subsequences, or output a causal graph structure for each class. 

Does variability in the final TX1day magnitude originate from early development or from recent history?
