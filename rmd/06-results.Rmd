## Relating TX1day T' variability to component variability

The variance decomposition on 40 years of ERA5 data reveals large spatial diversity in year-to-year TX1day variance (Figure \@ref(fig:vardecomp)). As anticipated, the patterns closely resemble those of the mean of TX1day magnitudes in Rothlisberger and Papritz (2023), since the variance is un-normalized and therefore scales with magnitude. There is a strong ocean-land contrast, with low variances in the order of 2 K$^2$ over oceans and mostly above 4 K$^2$ over land. A general trend over land is the increase in variability further from the Equator. There exists nonetheless important exceptions: the West coasts of North America, West coasts of Southern Chile, South-western coasts of Australia and the West coasts between Mauritania and Northern Europe all exhibit large TX1day variability, while tropical land such as the Amazonia, South-east Asia and Indonesia, equatorial Africa and parts of the Eastern Saharan show low variability compared to the oceans. The largest peaks of variability occur in the bay of the Antarctic Peninsula and an oceanic hot spot centered at 70&deg; S 160&deg; W, as well as relatively large hotspots in the coastal regions described above. 

Individual contributors have mostly larger variance and vary spatially with no single contributor dominating globally. The advective and adiabatic $T'$ variance have similar spatial distribution over land, while they seem to complement each other over oceans with large adiabatic $T'$ variance in the extra-tropics and large adiabatic $T'$ variance in the sub-tropics. Key hotspots of very large variance for both contributors include regions of high topography (particularly over Rockies, the Andes and the Himalayas) as well as the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, with values mostly above 32 K$^2$ and 64 K$^2$ respectively. In comparison, the variances of diabatic $T'$ are more uniform with a less pronounced ocean-land contrast, and are particularly small over oceans east of the continents at the Equator with values between 0 and 2 K$^2$. The storm track regions, especially the upstream portions of the NH, have larger advective $T'$ variance than the surrounding oceans, which resembles the TX1day variance map. 

Covariances between contributors are predominantly negative and again display diverse spatial patterns. The covariances between advective and adiabatic $T'$ are positive only over the extra-tropical oceans; between advective and diabatic $T'$ over small regions in the tropical oceans and the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets; between diabatic and adiabatic $T'$ over regions of high topography and within the African and Australian continents. Over oceans, the covariance between advective-adiabatic and advective-diabatic complement each other with positive and negative contributions, while the covariance between diabatic and adiabatic $T'$ is almost always negative. 

Spatial patterns in mean magnitude of contributors mainly agree with those in the variance over land, but not over the oceans. The advective $T'$ patterns are most different on the coast of Western North-America, coastal North-western Africa and the ocean region West of Australia. The diabatic $T'$ patterns are the most different, in particular over Southern hemisphere oceans, where the mean patterns show much stronger latitudinal gradient and miss important large-variance regions on the west of the continents. The adiabatic $T'$ patterns instead shows good agreement over the oceans, while some differences exist in the Sahara, eastern North-America and the storm tracks, both in the Northern and Southern hemispheres.

Similarly to mean-characteristics, the ocean-land contrasts in TX1day variance can be explained by water's larger heat capacity, since a slower temperature gain by solar radiation limits the short-term gain in temperature of a parcel. This is supported by a more uniform diabatic $T'$ variance over oceans and suggests that cloud cover can influence $T'$ growth particularly at the end of TX1day event trajectories when parcels are close to the ocean surface. Regions of larger variance over oceans - in TX1day $T'$ and all contributors - are found near the coasts and can be attributed to trajectories that predominately evolve over land and therefore involve more variable heat-generating mechanisms. 

For example, the variability hotspot located on North-Western African coast involves the typical summer-time Azores high-pressure system inducing trade winds from North and the Saharan low-pressure system inducing the Harmattan winds that originate from the continent (Adame et al., 2022), converging on the Moroccan coast and travelling in a South-westerly direction along the coast. Yearly variability in this synoptic situation can then lead to changes in the contributions from trade winds or Harmattan winds, that evolve very differently.

The mean decomposition showed large cancellation between contributors in many regions. The generally large and negative covariances supports this fact. Furthermore, these regions tend to exhibit large variance in both/either/one of the contributing processes. The Northern and Southern Hemisphere storm tracks have large mean positive contributions from advective $T'$ with large dampening by diabatic $T'$, while small but positive contributions from advective $T'$. This study confirms that observed variability in the TX1day $T'$ is impacted both by variability in these competing mechanisms, but additionally finds moderate contribution from adiabatic $T'$ and the covariance between advective and adiabtic $T'$ in the upstream portion of the storm tracks, that has previously been neglected. This observation is also noted in Easten Brazil, continental southern Africa, Australia and the northern East coast of North America - although with diabatic $T'$ and advective $T'$ contributing positively and negatively in the mean, respectively. This is highly significant since changes in variability of hot extremes under climate change may not only be influenced by changes in mean-dominant physical processes, but also those that affect second-moment characteristics, supporting work by Simolo and Corti (2022). 

Assessing the variability in these dampening mechanisms, or attributing importance of the positive or negative contributor, is difficult without considering the temporal evolution of these interactions. However, the spatial patterns in the covariance between the contributors is then a useful tool in determining regions where competing effects are present and influence the observed variability of resulting TX1day events. Furthermore, the diversity in covariance patterns is suggestive of complex and sensitive TX1day events.

## Comparing contributions to TX1day T' mean and variance

Figure XX maps the most important contributor/s - according to to the definition introduced in [Methods][Decomposition of TX1day anomalies and their yearly variance] - for the mean (Rothlisberger and Papritz, 2023) and variance decompositions to more concisely compare their differences.

In most oceanic and subtropical land, advective and/or adiabatic $T'$ dominates the mean while the variance is characterized additionally by significant contribution from diabatic $T'$. This is highlighted in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere storm tracks. In remaining regions with mean-dominating diabatic $T'$, the variance of TX1day $T'$ is dominated by diabatic $T'$ and most often advective $T'$ - such as in Equatorial Africa, Eastern South America, Western Australia and Eastern India. In fact, only few regions have a single dominating contributor in the variance. The North-western African, South-western African and Western North-american coasts, a large part of the Mediterranean and the tropical Pacific are dominated by adiabatic processes. Small regions in the Amazonia, Western equatorial Africa and small regions south of the Northern Hemisphere storm tracks are dominated by diabatic processes. Finally, the upstream portion of the Northern Hemisphere storm tracks and a small coastal band around the Antarctic are dominated by advective processes. 

Regions of high-topography, high adiabatic in mean vs additional advective influence in variance. Thoughts? 

The coastal regions that showed peaks in TX1day $T'$ variance are primarily dominated by adiabatic $T'$ both in the variance and in the mean.

Important disagreement between the maps involve only small regions. Off the Southern-East coast of Australia, advective $T'$ mostly dominates the mean while adiabatic and diabatic $T'$ dominate the variance.

Although the larger influence of diabatic $T'$ globally supports previous evidence that radiative and land surface processes dominate sub-tropical changes in summer-time near-surface temperature variability (Holmes et al., 2016), this work further highlights the importance in considering all three heat-generating mechanisms. Furthermore, over Australia, advective processes have been understood to be dominating the observed changes in summer-time near-surface temperature variability (Watterson et al., 2008; Holmes et al., 2016). This study agrees, but further insists that for hot extremes, both diabatic - dominant in the West - and adiabatic processes cannot be ignored. 

Then the variance of TX1day $T'$ is almost entirely dominated by more processes than its mean counterpart. The implications is that process understanding of hot extreme development, particularly over land, requires more careful examination of changes in the physical processes due to climate changes. In showing that less important mechanisms for mean characterization of TX1day events - such as advective processes in western Europe - become significant when quantifying year-to-year variability, this study suggests a r

## Inter-component variability structure

The covariances discussed in [6.1][Relating TX1day T' variability to component variability] are useful in quantifying the importance of contributor interactions to TX1day variance, but could not provide a clear characterization of the dependence structures. To address this limitation, this section focuses only on the variability of the contributors. Applying PCA to yearly TX1day event $T'$ decompositions at every location on Earth and examining the resulting proportion of explained variance by each component (figure \@ref(fig:pca_explainedvar)) reveals that the advective, adiabatic and diabatic $T'$ contributions are constrained by one or two main axes of variability.

The central Andes and Himalayan plateaus, off the southern and eastern coast of Sri-lanka, the South China and Philippines seas as well as regions of the coast of the Antarctic have over 95\% of their variance in the contributors explained by the first PC. The regions of high topography highlighted in section [6.1][Relating TX1day T' variability to component variability] to have very large covariance contributions then indicate strong coupling between all three components. The tropical regions were not observed to have such structures due to the presence of relatively small TX1day $T'$ values. This is a surprising result, as the weather in this region is modulated by diverse mechanisms including large circulation patterns induced by SST anomalies in the Pacific and Indian oceans as well as strong soil moisture - temperature feedbacks (Jiang et al., 2023).

Most of the remaining oceans, large parts of Africa and the middle East, Easter Australia, Greenland and the Antarctic, the western North-america and North-eastern South America  have between 70 and 95\% of the variance explained by the first PC. This suggests that, globally, TX1day event contributor trajectories evolve under strong physical constraints. BLAH BLAH BLAH. 

Then, only few regions require three PCs to explain over 85\% of the variance in the three contributors. These are almost always land areas - apart from small regions off the coast of Norway and North-western Russia. 

The analysis of total contributions to TX1day $T'$ variance of the advective, adiabatic and diabatic processes and their dependence structure is however limited since it does not consider any temporal information. Contributions from a process may occur at any point in the trajectory and the presence of cyclic processes may inflate magnitudes of the final decomposition. To more precisely attribute ...

## Extras

What do we want to discuss here:
* Try to explain the largest patterns that occur: land-ocean contrast, coastal hotspots, mountain and arctic hotspots, talk about European hot extremes maybe. 
* Relate the findings to the literature: The paper from Laura, dampening mechanisms with the paper from Matthias, tropical lows and soil moisture effects. How does soil moisture affect the variability of hot extreme events year-to-year? One may say the variability in soil moisture is important. 
* Don't re-invent the wheel: talk about the differences to mean-characteristics.
