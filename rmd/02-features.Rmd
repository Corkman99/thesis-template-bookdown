# Features

`bookdownplus` extends the features of `bookdown`, and simplifies the
procedure. Users only have to choose a template, clarify the book title and
author name, and then focus on writing the text. No need to struggle in YAML
and LaTeX.
With `bookdownplus` users can

-   record guitar chords,

-   write a mail in an elegant layout,

-   write a laboratory journal, or a personal diary,

-   draw a monthly or weekly or conference calendar,

-   and, of course, write academic articles in your favourite way,

-   with chemical molecular formulae and equations,

-   even in Chinese,

-   and more wonders will come soon.

Full documentation can be found in the book 
[R bookdownplus Textbook](https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus). The webpage 
looks so-so, while the 
[pdf file](https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus/bookdownplus.pdf) might give
you a little surprise.
