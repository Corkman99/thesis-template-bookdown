## Relating TX1day $T'$ variability to component variability

The variance decomposition on 40 years of ERA5 data reveals large spatial diversity in year-to-year TX1day variance (Figure \@ref(fig:vardecomp)). As anticipated, the patterns closely resemble those of the mean of TX1day magnitudes in \citep{rothlisberger_quantifying_2023}, since the variance is un-normalized and therefore scales with magnitude. There is a strong ocean-land contrast, with low variances in the order of 2 K$^2$ over oceans and mostly above 4 K$^2$ over land. A general trend over land is the increase in variability further from the Equator. There exists nonetheless important exceptions: the West coasts of North America, West coasts of Southern Chile, South-western coasts of Australia and the West coasts between Mauritania and Northern Europe all exhibit large TX1day variability, while tropical land such as the Amazonia, South-east Asia and Indonesia, equatorial Africa and parts of the Eastern Saharan show low variability compared to the oceans. The largest peaks of variability occur in the bay of the Antarctic Peninsula and an oceanic hot spot centered at 70&deg; S 160&deg; W, as well as relatively large hotspots in the coastal regions described above. 

Individual contributors have mostly larger variance and vary spatially with no single contributor dominating globally. The advective and adiabatic $T'$ variance have similar spatial distribution over land, while they seem to complement each other over oceans with large adiabatic $T'$ variance in the extra-tropics and large adiabatic $T'$ variance in the sub-tropics. Key hotspots of very large variance for both contributors include regions of high topography (particularly over Rockies, the Andes and the Himalayas) as well as the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, with values mostly above 32 K$^2$ and 64 K$^2$ respectively. In comparison, the variances of diabatic $T'$ are more uniform with a less pronounced ocean-land contrast, and are particularly small over oceans east of the continents at the Equator with values between 0 and 2 K$^2$. The storm track regions, especially the upstream portions of the NH, have larger advective $T'$ variance than the surrounding oceans, which resembles the TX1day variance map. 

Covariances between contributors are predominantly negative and again display diverse spatial patterns. The covariances between advective and adiabatic $T'$ are positive only over the extra-tropical oceans; between advective and diabatic $T'$ over small regions in the tropical oceans and the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets; between diabatic and adiabatic $T'$ over regions of high topography and within the African and Australian continents. Over oceans, the covariance between advective-adiabatic and advective-diabatic complement each other with positive and negative contributions, while the covariance between diabatic and adiabatic $T'$ is almost always negative. 

Spatial patterns in mean magnitude of contributors mainly agree with those in the variance over land, but not over the oceans. The advective $T'$ patterns are most different on the coast of Western North-America, coastal North-western Africa and the ocean region West of Australia. The diabatic $T'$ patterns are the most different, in particular over Southern hemisphere oceans, where the mean patterns show much stronger latitudinal gradient and miss important large-variance regions on the west of the continents. The adiabatic $T'$ patterns instead shows good agreement over the oceans, while some differences exist in the Sahara, eastern North-America and the storm tracks, both in the Northern and Southern hemispheres.

Similarly to mean-characteristics, the ocean-land contrasts in TX1day variance can be explained by water's larger heat capacity, since a slower temperature gain by solar radiation limits the short-term gain in temperature of a parcel. This is supported by a more uniform diabatic $T'$ variance over oceans and suggests that cloud cover can influence $T'$ growth particularly at the end of TX1day event trajectories when parcels are close to the ocean surface. Regions of larger variance over oceans - in TX1day $T'$ and all contributors - are found near the coasts and can be attributed to trajectories that predominately evolve over land and therefore involve more variable heat-generating mechanisms. 

For example, the variability hotspot located on North-Western African coast involves the typical summer-time Azores high-pressure system inducing trade winds from North and the Saharan low-pressure system inducing the Harmattan winds that originate from the continent \citep{adame_saharan_2022}, converging on the Moroccan coast and travelling in a South-westerly direction along the coast. Yearly variability in this synoptic situation can then lead to changes in the contributions from trade winds or Harmattan winds, that evolve very differently.

The mean decomposition showed large cancellation between contributors in many regions. The generally large and negative covariances supports this fact. Furthermore, these regions tend to exhibit large variance in both/either/one of the contributing processes. The Northern and Southern Hemisphere storm tracks have large mean positive contributions from advective $T'$ with large dampening by diabatic $T'$, while small but positive contributions from adiabatic $T'$. This study confirms that observed variability in the TX1day $T'$ is impacted both by variability in these competing mechanisms, but additionally finds moderate contribution from adiabatic $T'$ and the covariance between advective and adiabtic $T'$ in the upstream portion of the storm tracks, that has previously been neglected. This observation is also noted in Easten Brazil, continental southern Africa, Australia and the northern East coast of North America - although with diabatic $T'$ and advective $T'$ contributing positively and negatively in the mean, respectively. This is highly significant since changes in variability of hot extremes under climate change may not only be influenced by changes in mean-dominant physical processes, but also those that affect second-moment characteristics, supporting work by \cite{simolo_quantifying_2022}. 

Assessing the variability in these dampening mechanisms, or attributing importance of the positive or negative contributor, is difficult without considering the temporal evolution of these interactions. However, the spatial patterns in the covariance between the contributors is then a useful tool in determining regions where competing effects are present and influence the observed variability of resulting TX1day events. Furthermore, the diversity in covariance patterns is suggestive of complex and sensitive TX1day events.

## Comparing contributions to TX1day $T'$ mean and variance

Figure  \@ref(fig:dominant) maps the most important contributor/s - according to to the definition introduced in [Methods][Variance decomposition of TX1day $T'$] - for the mean \citep{rothlisberger_quantifying_2023} and variance decompositions to more concisely compare their differences. 

In most oceanic and subtropical land, advective and/or adiabatic $T'$ dominates the mean while the variance is characterized additionally by significant contribution from diabatic $T'$. This is highlighted in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere storm tracks. In remaining regions with mean-dominating diabatic $T'$, the variance of TX1day $T'$ is dominated by diabatic $T'$ and most often advective $T'$ - such as in Equatorial Africa, Eastern South America, Western Australia and Eastern India. In fact, only few regions have a single dominating contributor in the variance. The North-western African, South-western African and Western North-american coasts, a large part of the Mediterranean and the tropical Pacific are dominated by adiabatic processes. Small regions in the Amazonia, Western equatorial Africa and small regions south of the Northern Hemisphere storm tracks are dominated by diabatic processes. Finally, the upstream portion of the Northern Hemisphere storm tracks and a small coastal band around the Antarctic are dominated by advective processes.

The coastal regions that showed peaks in TX1day $T'$ variance are primarily dominated by adiabatic $T'$ both in the variance and in the mean - the only contributor exhibiting perfect agreement globally. There is nonetheless a clear land-ocean contrast in the variance spatial patterns, as opposed to adiabatic dominating also over small land regions in the Mediterranean, the North-american east coast and the coast of Morocco. This indicates that the land-ocean boundaries not only strongly influence interdecadal variability of large-scale circulation patterns \citep{wake_landsea_2014}, but also local variability of hot extreme mechanisms.

Regions of high-topography mostly show adiabatic $T'$ dominating the mean with the additional advective $T'$ influence in the variance. This is expected given the large negative covariances between advective and adiabatic $T'$ in these regions, suggesting that hot extreme development is modulated by mechanisms with competing processes. However, regions with advective and adiabatic $T'$ dominance in the variance tend to cover larger areas, particularly over the Himalayas where this regions extends from the Caspian sea to Southern Mongolia, where diabatic $T'$ is a dominating term for the mean. Katabatic winds - high-density air flows that descend higher elevation slopes due to the force of gravity, thus represented as a positive adiabatic contribution - are highly prevalent in the Himalayas due the diabatic cooling of rising air by glacial surfaces. Under climate-change, observations have shown an increase in katabatic wind activity \citep{salerno_local_2023} that then suggest the advective cooling of these flows and its dampening effect on the adiabatic parcel are more susceptible to yearly variability than the contribution from diabatic heating such as from solar radiation along the parcel trajectory and diabatic cooling due to the influence of glaciers. 

Complete disagreement - i.e. no common contributors - between the maps involve only two regions. In the Southwestern Tasman Sea, advective $T'$ mostly dominates the mean while adiabatic and diabatic $T'$ dominate the variance. This may have important consequences for the understanding of marine heatwave development in the Tasman sea, which are attributed to both marine and atmospheric drivers, such as the positive phase of the Asymmetric Southern Annular Mode that is associated with lower wind speeds and increased downward solar radiation \citep{gregory_atmospheric_2023}. Since this driver does not occur every year, annual changes in diabatic $T'$ contributions may be more important than advective $T'$ changes in distinguishing between TX1day $T'$ magnitudes. In regions on the North-side of Asir mountain range (Arabian Peninsula), diabatic $T'$ mean-dominance is contrasted by advective and adiabatic $T'$ variance-dominance. In addition to the fact figure \@ref(fig:vardecomp) shows strong advective - adiabatic covariance in this region, this analysis suggests that year-to-year variability of the Indian Summer Monsoon - associated with strong subsidence and strengthening of northerly wind \citep{attada_role_2019} - particularly influences hot extreme magnitude variability in the Asir mountains and in its forefront. 

Although the larger influence of diabatic $T'$ globally supports previous evidence that radiative and land surface processes dominate sub-tropical changes in summer-time near-surface temperature variability \citep{holmes_robust_2015}, this work further highlights the importance in considering all three heat-generating mechanisms. Particularly over Australia, advective processes have been understood to be dominating the observed changes in summertime near-surface temperature variability \citep{watterson_changes_2008,holmes_robust_2015}. This study agrees, but further insists that for hot extremes, both diabatic - specifically in the West - and adiabatic processes cannot be ignored.

Then the variance of TX1day $T'$ is almost entirely dominated by more processes than its mean counterpart. The implications is that process understanding of hot extreme development, particularly over land, requires more careful examination of changes in the physical processes due to climate changes. This shows that less important mechanisms for mean characterization of TX1day events become significant when quantifying year-to-year variability.

## Characterizing contributor dependencies 

The covariances discussed in [4.1][Relating TX1day $T'$ variability to component variability] are useful in quantifying the importance of contributor interactions to TX1day $T'$ variance. Since the contributors may evolve on different magnitude scales in different parts of the world, covariances may be inadequate in investigate their dependence structures. This section adjusts for the relative scales of each contributor and uses PCA to focus on characterizing the observed variability only in the contributors.

Figure \@ref(fig:pcaexplainedvar) shows that there are only few regions that have over 90\% of explained variance by PC1. These are almost only over oceans and mostly in the vicinity of storm tracks - particularly between Australia and Antarctica and its coasts with over 95\% of explained variance - as well as over the tropical Pacific and in the Atlantic between Brazil and the Sahel region collocating with sea-surface temperature maxima. Additionally, the Northern Atlantic and Arctic Ocean have mostly over 80\% of variance explained by PC1. 

```{r pcaexplainedvar, fig.cap="Percentage of variance in advective, adiabatic and diabatic $T'$ that is explained by (a) PC1, (b) PC1 and PC2. The contributor directions most aligning with PC1 and PC2 - see 5.2 - for regions with at least 95\\% of variance explained by PC1 and PC2 are shown in (c) and (d), respectively. Regions with less are masked in light grey.", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.pos='h'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pca_explainedvar3.png")
```

The land regions with over 70\% of explained variance are generally limited to regions in the vicinity of high topography, but also Western and equatorial Africa and Northern Colombia. The remaining land regions have between 34 and 70\% of variance explained by PC1 - with the lowest values achieved in Northern Argentina, central Canada and Arctic Russia - and correspond to the areas requiring PC3 to explain more than 60\% of their $T'$ variance. 

The PC scores in figure \@ref(fig:pcaexplainedvar) (c-d) shows that even in regions with over 95\% of the variance explained by PC1 and PC2 - although being constrained to two degrees of freedom - the PCs do not clearly align with a single or two contributors. In fact, the PC1 map supports figure \@ref(fig:dominant) with very similar spatial patterns. All single-dominating regions in figure \@ref(fig:dominant) are however now shown to be variable in 2 or three axes. In tropical regions, where small variances may have influenced the reliability the utilized definition of dominance, some regions with no dominating variance term now show PC1 aligning mostly with advective and either adiabtic or diabatic $T'$. Finally, as geometrically expected, the PC2 score aligns most with the opposing contributors. 

Further interpreting the PC components is difficult without considering the temporal evolution, since the PCA is applied to the final decomposition which includes aggregated contributions. Nonetheless, this analysis demonstrates that hot extreme event trajectories involve strong dependencies between the three contributors and that they may be represented using only one or two degrees of freedom. In addition, the resulting axes of variability do not align well with the original contributors, but instead mostly involve both advective and adiabatic $T'$ over the oceans and both adiabatic and diabatic $T'$ over land.

## Forecasting the last 24h of TX1day trajectories

To more specifically study the dynamics between contributors of hot extreme events, we now consider the history of parcel trajectories and model them with an LSTM-based NN architecture. Recall that the final model is trained on half of all grid-points as illustrated in figure \@ref(fig:traintest) for years between 1980 to 1990. Then, figure \@ref(fig:mse) shows the accuracy of this model in predicting the final 24h of advective, adiabatic and diabatic $T'$ evolution, for the test set that consists of all grid-points for years between 1991 and 2020. 

```{r mse, fig.cap="Median mean-squared-error (MSE) loss over years 1991 to 2020 for the (a) total, (b) advective, (c) adiabatic and (d) diabatic forecasts. The line graph shows oceanic and terrestrial latitudinal averages in blue and green, respectively.", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.pos='h'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mse_final.png")
```

The model performs best over oceans in longitude bands between 30 and 45$^\circ$ latitude North and South, with MSE loss lower than 0.2 for all contributors. There is a strong land-ocean contrast evident in the full forecast as well as for each contributor, with exceptions for adiabtic $T'$ that performs very well over many land regions. The land areas that achieve low MSE loss include eastern North-America, regions east of the Andes, northern Eurasia and east China, with all three contributors being well-forecasted. The regions exhibiting the poorest performance include regions of high topography, the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets. In addition, hotspots that were observed to have large mean and variance in section [5.1][Relating TX1day $T'$ variability to component variability] such as the east coasts of Northern Africa, South and North America also have peaks in MSE loss that reach above 8$^\circ$C$^2$. 

Generally, the oceans are forecasted accurately, with only the advective term contributing considerable MSE loss in the tropics and both Northern and Southern storm-tracks. The two regions off the coasts of Southern Africa and South America that report 0.6 to 2$^\circ$C$^2$ median MSE loss collocate approximately with SST patterns associated with with ENSO. During positive and negative phases of ENSO, SST gradients in the tropical to subtropical eastern Pacific strengthen significantly, coupled with increased wind stress \citep[for e.g.][]{chelton_observations_2001}. Poor predictability of the advective $T'$ in this region may then be due to more diverse trends in the evolution of advective processes and their association to the ocean surface and diabatic processes. The hotspot in the Southern Atlantic may be further explained by similar SST variability associated with the South Atlantic Dipole, as well as its year-lagged teleconnection to ENSO \citep{ham_inter-basin_2021}.

Figure \@ref(fig:msebase) shows the accuracy of the baseline model: constant prediction of value 27h before the event for each contributor. This reveals a number of important insights both into the data and the limited performance of the LSTM model. A low MSE loss for tropical to mid-latitudinal oceanic regions is reasonable given that they also record the lowest average $T'$ magnitudes, with the areas that show larger mean adiabatic $T'$ also exhibiting larger MSE loss. The baseline outperforms the LSTM model in this areas, particularly due to advective $T'$ that is often wrongly predicted to increase by the LSTM.

```{r msebase, fig.cap="Median mean-squared-error (MSE) loss over years 1991 to 2020 for the (a) total, (b) advective, (c) adiabatic and (d) diabatic forecasts. The line graph shows oceanic and terrestrial latitudinal averages in blue and green, respectively.", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.pos='h'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mse_base.png")
```

The adiabatic term shows very small MSE loss over all oceans as well as parts of South America, eastern North American, India, Northern Eurasia and parts of Australia, suggesting that globally, little to no additional adiabatic heating occurs in the 24h preceding a TX1day event. However, previous work showed large adiabatic contributions to both mean and variance of event $T'$. We therefore hypothesize that hot extreme events over oceans tend to evolve from parcel trajectories that descend to the surface with significant positive contributing from adiabatic $T'$ at least 24h before the event. The final 24h period may then be dominated by diabatic $T'$ from atmosphere interactions with the ocean surface and advective $T'$ from prevailing circulation patterns. Exceptions occur consistently in coastal regions or in the Arctic circle, where literature supports persistent subsidence when the typical ice-sheet temperature inversion is weakened \citep{wille_extraordinary_2024}. 

We further investigate the regions successfully modeled by the LSTM and not with the constant baseline model - most notably, over oceans in longitude bands between 30 and 45$^\circ$ latitude North and South. Figure \@ref(fig:msegood) shows trajectory plots a location off the coast of Japan. Previous work reports that this region is mean-dominated by advective $T'$ and variance-dominated by advective and diabatic $T'$, which agrees with the large increases in advective $T'$ and large decreases in diabatic $T'$ during the last 1 to 2 days. In 2014, the LSTM model correctly predicts this behavior even though the TX1day event trajectory is just 1 timestep longer than the forecasting window, while in 2010 and 2012 it incorrectly predicts a decreasing diabatic $T'$ trend - this is otherwise generally correct, as seen for the remaining years. In fact, the model predicts 2$^\circ$C advective $T'$ gain, approximately constant zero adiabatic $T'$ and 0.5$^\circ$C diabatic $T'$ loss when given an input of zeros. This suggests that this is the most prevalent behavior of TX1day events with short $T'$ trajectories, since the model most likely outputs the average for timeseries when given un-informative histories as input.

Overall, the value of the LSTM model is limited as its poor ability to correctly reproduce typical dynamics means we are unable to trusts its behavior. Although outperformed over tropical oceans, it is often superior in performance against the constant baseline and this should be encouraging, indicating that in many regions, at least one of the contributor is predictable from the trajectory history. The model also generalized from the training regions to the validation regions well, as the areas of higher MSE loss do not seem to collocate with the validation locations. Then, particularly over oceans, this work suggests that forecasting future tendencies of TX1day trajectories is possible but necessitates a more complex model with more careful treatment of the inputs. We discuss potential avenues for improvement in [Chapter 6.2][Limitations and future work].
