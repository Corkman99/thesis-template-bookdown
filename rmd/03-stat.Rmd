## Predictor importance

There is a rich literature in applied statistics with the goal of quantifying predictor importance in regression with observational data 

Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold (1980) - referred as LMG - proposes to quantify predictor importance in a linear regression model by computing the average sequential sums-of-squares over all predictor orderings. Feldman (2005) extended this approach with Proportional Marginal Variance Decomposition (PMVD) that instead considers a weighted average with weights chosen to enforce the exclusion criteria - a predictor with zero coefficient is allocated zero importance (Gromping, 2007). Breiman (2001) instead proposes to measure importance of a predictor by assessing the model's loss of accuracy due to random permutations of the predictor.


## Deep Learning

Machine learning and in particular Deep Learning architectures have recently received a lot of attention in atmospheric and climate sciences due to their performance in modelling complex high-dimensional systems and their computational efficiency in comparison to Numeric Weather Prediction and Climate Models (eg. ...). Learning parameterizations from simulated and observational datasets has been the primary focus of DL applications (Barahona et al., 2023). The modelling and processing of data with sequential structure - such as timeseries - requires an architecture that can capture .... Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) ... Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are a type of RNN that were introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) to solve the problem of vanishing gradients in applications with long-term dependencies. 
Each LSTM layer is composed of three gates - the input, forget and output gates - that are recurrently computed one timestep at a time to update hidden states storing temporal information. An LSTM node processes input ... in the following way:

\begin{equation}
   V(\{ T' \}_{1:n}) = \sum_{c \in \{\text{adv},\text{adiab},\text{diab}\}} V(\{ c \}_{1:n} ) + \sum_{c, d \in \{\text{adv},\text{adiab},\text{diab}\} , c\neq d} \text{Cov}(\{ c \}_{1:n} ,\{ d \}_{1:n})
(\#eq:vardecomp)
\end{equation}
